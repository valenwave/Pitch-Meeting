**PRODUCER GUY:** So, you have a sequel to that murder mystery movie for me?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes sir, I do! The first one did great, so we're bringing back that southern detective for another go.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Benoit Blanc! I love that guy and his completely inexplicable accent.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** The thickest, sir. So this one is called *Glass Onion*.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Like the vegetable that makes people cry when they cut it?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly! It's about layers. So, we've got this tech billionaire, Miles Bron, who's basically a parody of every tech billionaire.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, so he’s super smart but also kind of an idiot?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** You got it. And he invites his group of old friends, who he calls "The Disruptors," to his private island in Greece for a weekend getaway.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A bunch of rich people on a private island? Sounds like a good, non-problematic time.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It sure is. There's a canceled fashion model, a men's rights Twitch streamer, a scientist who works for Miles, and a politician.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wow, that sounds like the worst group of people to be stuck on an island with.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It is! And also showing up is Miles' ex-business partner, Andi, who he totally screwed over. And also, Benoit Blanc is there.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Fun! So what’s the mystery?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, Miles has planned a murder mystery game for the weekend. He’s going to be the victim and they all have to solve his "murder."

**PRODUCER GUY:** A fake murder at a murder mystery party. Love it. I bet that goes exactly as planned.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It does not! See, the streamer guy, Duke, suddenly drops dead for real after drinking from Miles' glass.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, an actual murder at the fake murder party! Very meta. So someone was trying to poison the billionaire.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It seems that way! But then, the lights go out, there's a gunshot, and we see Andi get shot and fall to the ground, dead!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Whoa! So the person who had the biggest motive is dead now too? Things are getting complicated.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** They sure are. But then we have a big flashback that reveals everything.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Ooh, flashbacks that re-contextualize the whole first half of the movie are tight!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Right? So it turns out the woman we thought was Andi is actually her identical twin sister, Helen. The real Andi was found dead a week earlier, and Helen hired Benoit Blanc to find the killer.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A secret twin! Wow wow wow wow!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So Helen has been pretending to be her dead sister this whole time to see who reacts strangely.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Is it difficult to impersonate your twin sister in front of people who knew her for years?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Actually, it's super easy, barely an inconvenience.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, really?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah, she just has to act a little weird and hope nobody questions it too hard. They're all pretty self-absorbed.

**PRODUCER GUY:** That checks out. So who’s the killer?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It’s Miles! The billionaire! He killed Andi to stop her from revealing that he stole the company idea from her, which she had written on a cocktail napkin. And then he poisoned Duke because Duke saw him leaving Andi’s house the night she died.

**PRODUCER GUY:** The dumbest guy was the killer all along! Amazing. But how are they going to prove it?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, Helen finds the original napkin, but Miles just burns it.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh no! The evidence is gone! What does she do now?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** She has a bit of a breakdown and starts smashing all of Miles' glass statues.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Cathartic!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It is. And then she gets an idea. She uses a piece of "Klear," Miles' new, unstable hydrogen fuel, to start a massive fire.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A big fire! I love it.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** And the fire burns down the entire mansion, including the Mona Lisa, which Miles had on loan from the Louvre.

**PRODUCER GUY:** He had the Mona Lisa in his living room?! And she blows it up?!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** She sure does. And since destroying the Mona Lisa will ruin him financially and reputationally, all his "friends" finally turn on him and agree to testify. So he’s finished.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wow. Destroying a priceless work of art to own a tech bro. That is absolutely fantastic. A bunch of terrible rich people, a silly accent, and a giant explosion? This movie can’t possibly fail.
