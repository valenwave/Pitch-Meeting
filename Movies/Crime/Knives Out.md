**PRODUCER GUY:** So you have a new movie for me?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes sir, I do. It’s a classic whodunnit murder mystery.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Ooh, a whodunnit! Is it based on a board game? Those seem to be a thing we do now.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Not this time, sir. This one is about a super-rich, famous mystery novelist named Harlan Thrombey. On the night of his 85th birthday party, he dies.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh no! Who did it?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, that’s the mystery! It looks like he slit his own throat, so the police think it’s a suicide.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A suicide, you say? Well, that sounds like a very short mystery.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Ah, but then a world-famous private detective named Benoit Blanc shows up. Someone anonymously hired him and sent him a big envelope of cash because they suspect foul play.

**PRODUCER GUY:** An envelope of cash? That’s how we’re doing things? Not a wire transfer or a Zelle payment?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It’s more mysterious this way. So Benoit Blanc is going to interview the whole family, because it turns out every single one of them had a reason to want the old man dead.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So they’re all terrible, greedy people?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Oh, the absolute worst. They’re all living off his money and they’re all lying about something. So Blanc starts questioning them one by one.

**PRODUCER GUY:** And what's this detective's deal? Is he a grizzled, hard-boiled film noir type?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Not exactly. He has a very, very thick southern accent for some reason.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A southern accent? He’s investigating a murder in Massachusetts with a Kentucky Fried accent?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He describes the case as a donut.

**PRODUCER GUY:** As a what now?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** A donut with a hole in the middle, and his job is to find the smaller donut hole inside the bigger donut hole.

**PRODUCER GUY:** That metaphor is a donut hole.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So anyway, there’s also Harlan’s nurse, Marta. She’s the only one who actually liked him. And she has a very specific condition.

**PRODUCER GUY:** What is it?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** She’s physically incapable of telling a lie. If she does, she projectile vomits.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wow. That is an incredibly convenient physical condition to have for a character in a murder mystery movie.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** I know! So then we see a flashback of what *really* happened that night. Marta was giving Harlan his nightly medicine, but she accidentally grabbed the wrong bottle and gave him a fatal overdose of morphine!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh my god! So she’s the killer!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, Harlan is a mystery writer, so to protect her from being blamed, he quickly comes up with this super elaborate plan for her to sneak out of the house, create a fake alibi, and then he slits his own throat to make it look like a suicide.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wow. So a world-renowned creator of intricate mysteries comes up with a plan that immediately attracts a world-renowned detective?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** That’s right! So now Marta has to try and survive the investigation without telling a lie and vomiting all over the expensive carpets. And Benoit Blanc makes her his little sidekick because he can tell she’s a good person.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A sidekick who might be the killer? That’s smart.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It is! And then the family’s golden boy grandson, Ransom, who is also Captain America, shows up and decides to help Marta.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, Captain America is here to save the day!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Seems like it! But then, at the reading of the will, it turns out Harlan left everything—the house, the money, his publishing company—all to Marta!

**PRODUCER GUY:** The whole donut!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** The whole donut! The family is furious and they turn on her. But don't worry, Benoit Blanc figures it all out.

**PRODUCER GUY:** I bet he does.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** See, Ransom was the one who hired him! He found out his grandfather was cutting him out of the will, so he snuck in, switched the labels on the medicine vials, and stole the antidote so that Marta would kill Harlan and be ineligible to inherit.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A very evil plan.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** But it gets better! Marta is such a good nurse that she gave Harlan the *correct* medicine without even looking at the label, just by the feel of the liquid. She only *thought* she poisoned him. So Harlan killed himself for absolutely no reason!

**PRODUCER GUY:** So the master mystery writer outsmarted himself into committing suicide to cover up a murder that never even happened?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly! So then Ransom tries to kill Marta with a knife in front of everybody, but it turns out to be a retractable prop knife from the giant knife throne in the living room.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A giant knife throne?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It’s a thing. And it’s a good thing too, because now Ransom is caught and arrested, and Marta inherits everything. The last shot is her standing on the balcony of her new mansion, looking down on the pathetic family, sipping coffee from a mug that says "My House, My Rules, My Coffee."

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wow. A classic whodunnit with a fun modern twist, a bunch of movie stars, and Chris Evans in a comfy sweater. People are going to love this. It's smart, it's funny, it feels original. I see a hit.
