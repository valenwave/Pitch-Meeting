**PRODUCER GUY:** So, you have a movie for me?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes sir, I do. It’s a big, bright, colorful musical about dreamers in Los Angeles.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A musical? Are people still into those?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Sir, people are always into watching attractive people fall in love while singing and dancing.

**PRODUCER GUY:** That's a good point. I am one of those people. So what’s it about?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So the movie opens on a massive traffic jam on an L.A. freeway. But instead of everyone getting angry, they all jump out of their cars and perform a huge, single-take song and dance number.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, wow. So Los Angeles traffic is actually fun and whimsical?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** In this movie it is! So that’s where we meet our two leads. There’s Mia, a barista who dreams of being an actress, and Sebastian, a jazz pianist who wants to open his own club.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Let me guess, they meet and fall in love?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Eventually! Their first few interactions are actually kind of rude and dismissive.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Ah, the classic "they hate each other so they'll definitely love each other" trope. Love that.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly. So Sebastian gets fired from his restaurant gig for playing his own passionate jazz instead of the simple Christmas songs he was told to play. Mia overhears it and is captivated.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So she goes to talk to him?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, he just brushes past her angrily. But don’t worry, they meet again at a pool party where Sebastian is playing keytar in an 80s cover band.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A keytar? So he’s really selling out his jazz principles.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He’s a starving artist, sir. So they finally connect and start to fall for each other, and there are lots of musical numbers. They tap dance on a hill overlooking the city, they go to the movies...

**PRODUCER GUY:** Sounds romantic.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It is! At one point they go to the Griffith Observatory and they start dancing and literally float up into the stars.

**PRODUCER GUY:** They float? Like, they have powers now?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, it’s a visual representation of the magic of falling in love.

**PRODUCER GUY:** The magic of love giving people the ability to ignore gravity is tight!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So Mia encourages Sebastian to pursue his dream, and he encourages her to write her own one-woman play instead of just going to soul-crushing auditions. But Sebastian realizes he needs financial stability, so he joins a popular jazz-fusion band led by his old acquaintance, played by John Legend.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, so he compromises his artistic integrity for a steady paycheck. A tale as old as time.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** And he gets pretty famous! But he’s always on tour, and he misses Mia’s big premiere of her play.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh no. How did the play go?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It was a complete bomb. Hardly anyone showed up and she overheard people making fun of it as they left.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Yikes. So now she’s heartbroken and her dream is crushed, and her boyfriend wasn’t even there.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** You got it. They have a massive fight and break up. Mia is so defeated that she moves back home to Nevada.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Man, this musical got depressing all of a sudden.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** But then! A big casting director who was at Mia's play loved it and wants her to audition for a huge movie. But she's gone!

**PRODUCER GUY:** So how will they ever find her?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, Sebastian takes the call, gets in his car, and just drives to her hometown to convince her to come back for one last shot.

**PRODUCER GUY:** He just drives to another state hoping to find her?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Super easy, barely an inconvenience.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, really?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah, he just honks his horn outside her house until she comes out. So she goes to the audition, nails it by telling a heartfelt story about her aunt, and gets the part.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Fantastic! So now they get back together and she becomes a star and he opens his jazz club and they live happily ever after!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No.

**PRODUCER GUY:** What?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** They talk and realize that their dreams are going to take them in different directions, but they’ll always love each other. Then we flash-forward five years.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Okay...

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** And Mia is now a massive movie star. She’s married to another guy and they have a daughter.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh my god. What happened to Sebastian? Did he drink himself to death in a keytar-related accident?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Not at all! Mia and her husband randomly walk into a jazz club, and who’s on stage playing the piano? Sebastian. And the name of the club is "Seb's," the name she suggested. He did it.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wow wow wow... wow. So their eyes meet across the crowded room?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** They do. And as he starts to play their love theme, we go into a seven-minute-long fantasy sequence of the life they could have had together if he had just kissed her that first night at the restaurant. We see their whole life flash by—Paris, marriage, a kid, all of it.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So you made a whole second movie and put it at the end of the first movie?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Pretty much. Then we snap back to reality. He finishes the song, they share a small, sad, knowing smile, and she leaves with her husband. The end.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So the romantic leads don't end up together in the romantic musical? That's a bold choice. It’s sad and beautiful and people who love crying will make this movie a ton of money. The Academy is gonna love this!
