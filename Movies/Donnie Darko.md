**PRODUCER GUY:** So you have a movie for me?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes sir, I do. It’s a mind-bending psychological thriller for teens.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, a thriller for teenagers. So is it about the horror of their favorite social media app shutting down for an hour?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Not quite. So, our main character is this troubled teenager named Donnie Darko. One night he sleepwalks out of his house because a six-foot-tall rabbit named Frank tells him to.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A giant rabbit. Is this a kid's movie? Are they going on a fun adventure to find colorful eggs?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Actually, Frank is very demonic-looking and tells Donnie the world is going to end in 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes, and 12 seconds.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, a very specific apocalypse. So the rabbit has a watch?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It would seem so. And when Donnie gets home the next morning, he finds out a jet engine has crashed right into his bedroom.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Woah! That’s a big deal! So the whole movie is about the mystery of this jet engine, right? The FAA investigators are baffled, I bet.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** They are! But we don’t really focus on that. We’re more interested in Donnie going to therapy and seeing these weird, watery spears coming out of people’s chests.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Water spears. So he has water powers? Is he related to Aquaman?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, it’s a manifestation of his Fourth Dimensional powers as the Living Receiver.

**PRODUCER GUY:** The what-now?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So, this Frank the rabbit keeps telling him to do stuff, like flood his high school. Donnie uses an axe to break a water main.

**PRODUCER GUY:** That sounds like vandalism. Is our hero a hero?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He’s complicated! Anyway, because the school is flooded, he gets to walk his new girlfriend, Gretchen, home. See, the vandalism was romantic.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Flooding a school to get a girl to like you is tight!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Then his science teacher gives him a book called "The Philosophy of Time Travel," written by a very old local lady the kids call "Grandma Death."

**PRODUCER GUY:** Grandma Death wrote a book about time travel. Of course she did. What’s in it?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It explains everything! The jet engine is an "Artifact," Donnie is the "Living Receiver," and this whole movie takes place in an unstable "Tangent Universe" that will collapse and destroy the real "Primary Universe."

**PRODUCER GUY:** So you’re just going to give the audience a textbook to explain the movie?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** We’re going to give the main character the textbook, yes. So anyway, Frank convinces Donnie to burn down the house of this popular motivational speaker, Jim Cunningham.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Our hero is now an arsonist. Fantastic. Why?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Because it turns out the motivational speaker has a secret child pornography dungeon!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh my god!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah! So with that guy arrested, Donnie’s mom has to chaperone a flight for his little sister’s dance team, leaving Donnie and his older sister to throw a Halloween party.

**PRODUCER GUY:** This seems to be escalating very conveniently.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Actually, it’s going to be super easy, barely an inconvenience.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, really?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah, see, during the party, Donnie realizes the world is about to end, so he takes Gretchen to see Grandma Death. But they get attacked by some bullies, Gretchen gets thrown into the street and is run over by a car.

**PRODUCER GUY:** No! That’s awful!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** And guess who’s driving the car? It’s his older sister’s boyfriend, and he’s wearing the Frank the rabbit costume!

**PRODUCER GUY:** What?! Why was he wearing that?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Halloween party. So Donnie, in a rage, shoots him in the eye, which is the same eye Frank the rabbit was missing in his visions.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wow wow wow… wow. So Donnie created the ghost rabbit that was telling him to do stuff all along?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly! He had to ensure Frank would become the "Manipulated Dead" to guide him.

**PRODUCER GUY:** All these capitalized words are making my head hurt.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So, with his girlfriend dead, Donnie realizes what he has to do. He uses his telekinesis to rip the engine off the plane his mom and sister are on and sends it through a time portal back 28 days.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wait, he tears an engine off a plane with his mind? And his family is on that plane!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yup! And the portal sends the engine back to crash into his own bedroom. The movie rewinds, and we see Donnie back in his bed on the first night. He just lies there laughing as the engine comes down and kills him, thus closing the Tangent Universe and saving everyone.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So he kills himself to save a world where his girlfriend is still alive, but she’ll never know who he is, and everyone else just wakes up from some weird dreams.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** That's the gist of it! It's very deep.

**PRODUCER GUY:** It sounds confusing and depressing. I’m not sure people will get it, but the kids love sad stuff. It’ll probably do okay.
