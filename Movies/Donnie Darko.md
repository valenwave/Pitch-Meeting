## Pitch Meeting: Donnie Darko

**INT. STUDIO EXECUTIVE OFFICE - DAY**

PRODUCER GUY sits across from SCREENWRITER GUY, who clutches a worn, heavily annotated script. A half-eaten Danish sits on Producer Guy's desk.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, what have you got for me today, Screenwriter Guy? Something with a franchise potential? Maybe a talking animal? People love talking animals.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, it's... it's about a teenager. His name is Donnie Darko.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Donnie Darko. Okay. Is he like, a cool, relatable teen? Does he wear, like, cool skater clothes?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He's... troubled. He sleepwalks, goes to therapy. And one night, he's led out of his house by a giant, demonic-looking rabbit named Frank.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A giant, demonic-looking rabbit? Sir, are you high?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, no! It's, uh, it's symbolic! Or maybe it's real! We'll leave it ambiguous. So Frank tells him the world is going to end in 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes, and 12 seconds.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Specific. Very specific. So, like, a ticking clock movie? Is it an action movie? Does he have to, like, assemble a team of other troubled teens to fight the rabbit?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Not exactly. Right after Frank tells him this, a jet engine crashes into his bedroom. But he wasn't in it, because Frank led him outside.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, so Frank *saved* him. Is Frank good then? Is he, like, a guardian angel rabbit?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, Frank then starts telling Donnie to do things. Like, flood the school.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Flood the school?! Okay, so now he's a delinquent. So our hero is a troubled, possibly schizophrenic teen who takes orders from a giant rabbit to commit vandalism? This is very... niche.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** But then he meets a girl, Gretchen! And they fall in love! And there's this old lady, "Grandma Death," who gives him a book about time travel called "The Philosophy of Time Travel."

**PRODUCER GUY:** "Grandma Death." Catchy. Is she also a talking animal? Is she a zombie?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, she's just an old lady who writes about tangent universes and artifacts. And there's also a really slimy motivational speaker, Jim Cunningham, played by Patrick Swayze.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Patrick Swayze! Okay, now you're talking! So he's, like, a good guy in this? He's teaching people to dance?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Actually, Donnie burns down his house, and they find a bunch of child pornography.

**PRODUCER GUY:** ...Right. So, a dark comedy then? A coming-of-age drama with a side of child pornography? I'm sensing a very confused marketing team here.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, it's all leading somewhere! Donnie is, like, the "Living Receiver." He has to send the jet engine back in time to prevent a tangent universe from collapsing and destroying the primary universe.

**PRODUCER GUY:** He has to... send a jet engine... back in time? How does one do that? Does he, like, get a time machine, or a DeLorean?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, he just... does it. With his mind. Or, well, he orchestrates things so it happens. And in the end, he dies, but it saves everyone!

**PRODUCER GUY:** So the hero dies? At the end of the movie? After all that? That's a real bummer, Screenwriter Guy. People like happy endings. Or at least, they like it when the hero lives and punches the bad rabbit.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** But it's a *meaningful* death! It's a sacrifice! It makes you think!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Makes you think, huh? About what, where I left my car keys? Look, it's got a talking rabbit, a charismatic lead who's a bit of a deviant, and a plot that sounds like you pulled it out of a dream. People might be into that. It's got cult classic written all over it. I'm going to say it'll do okay.

**PRODUCER GUY:** (Muttering) Just need to figure out how to explain the rabbit...
