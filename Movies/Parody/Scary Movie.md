**PRODUCER GUY:** So you have a movie for me?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes sir, I do. I was thinking we should make a movie that pokes fun at all those teen slasher movies that are so popular right now.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A parody movie, huh? What are you gonna call it?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Get ready for this… *Scary Movie*.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wow. That’s the most straightforward title I have ever heard. I love it. So what’s it about?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So it’s about this group of teenagers, and one night they accidentally hit a guy with their car.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh no! So they call the police and deal with the tragic consequences of their actions?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Nope! They decide to dump his body off a pier and make a pact to never speak of it again.

**PRODUCER GUY:** That seems like a very irresponsible decision that will definitely not come back to haunt them.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It absolutely will, sir. One year later, a killer in a Ghostface mask starts stalking them.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So you’re basically just combining *Scream* and *I Know What You Did Last Summer*?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly! We’re also going to spoof *The Matrix*, *The Blair Witch Project*, and *The Usual Suspects*.

**PRODUCER GUY:** All the big ones! So who is our main character?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Our final girl is Cindy Campbell. And she and her friends—Brenda, Buffy, Greg, Ray, and her boyfriend Bobby—start getting picked off one by one.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Let me guess, the opening scene is a spoof of the Drew Barrymore scene from *Scream*?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It sure is! A girl gets a call from the killer, but instead of asking about scary movies, he and his friends are just shouting "Wassup!" back and forth at each other.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, that’s a very popular beer commercial. Referencing things is tight!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Then the killer chases her, stabs her in her silicone breast implant, and runs her over with his car.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So this killer is pretty menacing, huh?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Not at all. He’s super clumsy. He’s constantly tripping, getting into fights, and at one point he even gets high with one of the characters, Shorty.

**PRODUCER GUY:** The killer takes a smoke break with one of his potential victims?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah, they just chill for a bit. Anyway, the killer starts taking out the friends in ridiculous ways. Buffy, the beauty queen, gets beheaded. And Brenda gets stabbed to death by the entire audience in a movie theater because she won't stop talking.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wow, I think we’ve all wanted to do that at some point. So who’s investigating all this?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** That would be Officer Doofy, the intellectually disabled brother of Buffy. He’s a clear parody of Dewey from *Scream*.

**PRODUCER GUY:** An intellectually disabled police officer?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Let’s just say he puts the “special” in Special Officer.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Okay then. So what happens at the end?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, there’s a big party at Cindy’s house, and the killer shows up and causes chaos. It’s revealed that the killers are her boyfriend Bobby and his friend Ray, who were just copying the real killer.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Just like in *Scream*! So they have some elaborate, vengeful motive?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Nope, they’re just doing it. But then the *real* killer shows up and stabs them both.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Plot twist! So who’s the real killer?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It’s Doofy! He was faking his disability the entire time.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Whoa! It’s going to be hard for him to get away with all that.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Actually, it’s going to be super easy, barely an inconvenience.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, really?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah, he just takes off his disguise, gets in a car with a news reporter he’s been manipulating, and drives off into the sunset.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Mimicking the end of *The Usual Suspects* is tight! Well, a movie that makes fun of other, more successful movies seems like a recipe for success. It’s crass, low-brow, and relies entirely on pop culture references. People are going to love this.
