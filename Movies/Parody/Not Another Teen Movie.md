**PRODUCER GUY:** So you have a movie for me?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes sir, I do. You know all those teen movies from the 90s and early 2000s?

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh yeah, the ones where the nerdy girl is actually super hot if she just takes her glasses off and undoes her ponytail?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly! So my idea is, what if we made a movie that’s just all of those movies crammed into one?

**PRODUCER GUY:** So you want to just copy a bunch of successful movies and mash them together?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** But as a parody, sir. We’ll call it *Not Another Teen Movie*.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, making fun of something while also profiting from its formula is tight! So what’s the plot we're stealing... I mean, parodying the most?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, it's basically *She's All That*. We've got the popular jock, Jake Wyler, who is super handsome and beloved.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Let me guess, he gets dumped by the head cheerleader?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He sure does! So his smug friend makes a bet with him that he can't turn any girl into the prom queen.

**PRODUCER GUY:** And who does he pick?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** The school's designated "pretty ugly girl," Janey Briggs. She wears glasses, has a ponytail, and even has paint on her overalls!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, the horror! So she’s one of those art kids who nobody realizes is a total knockout?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** You know it! So Jake starts trying to win her over, but it’s tough.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Why, because he has to overcome her deep-seated insecurities and earn her trust?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, because he tries to woo her by stripping naked in her bedroom and covering himself in whipped cream and a banana.

**PRODUCER GUY:** He does what now?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It’s a parody of *Varsity Blues*. He asks her if she’s hungry. She is not.

**PRODUCER GUY:** That sounds incredibly uncomfortable.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It is! And we’re going to have tons of other characters, too. There’s the token black guy, Malik, who just shows up to say things like, “Oh, hell no!”

**PRODUCER GUY:** A very layered character.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** There’s also Jake’s sister, Catherine, who is constantly trying to sleep with him.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wait, what?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It's a parody of *Cruel Intentions*, sir. It’s supposed to be shocking.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Well, mission accomplished. So what happens next? Does the ugly duckling become a swan?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** She sure does. They give her this big makeover, and she walks down the stairs in slow motion, and everyone is stunned by how beautiful she is now that she’s not wearing glasses or a ponytail.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Even though she looked exactly the same before, just with accessories?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Precisely! So they start to fall for each other for real during a big party scene where a kid gets his head stuck in a toilet.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Toilet humor is a cornerstone of cinema.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** And then we get to the prom. Jake is crowned Prom King, and Janey is crowned Prom Queen! The bet was a success!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wow, so everyone is happy and the movie ends there?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Nope! Then the smug friend reveals the bet to everyone, Janey is heartbroken, and she runs off.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh no! It’s going to be tough for Jake to win her back now.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Actually, it’s going to be super easy, barely an inconvenience.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, really?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah, see, he just has to do a big, heartfelt slow clap. But he gets it wrong, so an airport attendant played by Molly Ringwald has to teach him how to do it correctly. Then he goes to her house, they reconcile, and he takes her back to the prom.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wait, Molly Ringwald? From the John Hughes movies this thing is making fun of?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** She’s one of many cameos from classic teen movies! It’ll be great! And then they kiss on the football field as the credits roll.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So it’s a movie that makes fun of clichés by following every single one of them, just with more nudity and gross jokes?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** That’s the idea, sir!

**PRODUCER GUY:** It sounds completely unoriginal and juvenile. I think it's going to be a huge hit!
