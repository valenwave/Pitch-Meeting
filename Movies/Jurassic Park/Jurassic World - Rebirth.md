### INT. PRODUCER GUY'S OFFICE - DAY

PRODUCER GUY sits at his desk, polishing a golf club. SCREENWRITER GUY sits nervously opposite him, clutching a folder.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, "Jurassic World Rebirth." You got a pitch for me, or is it another "dinosaurs are loose on the mainland and it's kinda inconvenient for everyone" thing? Because, honestly, we did that. Twice. It was… fine.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, no, Producer Guy! This is *different*. It's a rebirth! A… *re-birth* of the franchise!

**PRODUCER GUY:** (Raises an eyebrow) Is it? Because the last one ended with dinosaurs just sort of… living amongst us. Like really big pigeons. So what's the "rebirth" part? Did they all die and come back as zombie dinosaurs? Because that’s a pitch I’d listen to.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, almost! Five years after *Dominion*, it turns out most of the escaped dinosaurs aren't doing so great. The climate, you see. Not exactly ideal for a velociraptor. So, the last surviving pockets are on a remote, secret island that was *another* InGen research facility!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Another one? How many secret InGen facilities are there? Is there one under my desk? Because I’m pretty sure I would have noticed if a Dilophosaurus was spitting venom at my stapler.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** (Sweating) This one was hidden for decades! And the dinosaurs there? They've been left to their own devices, so they've… mutated.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Mutated? So, not just dinosaurs, but *super* dinosaurs? With laser eyes? Please tell me they have laser eyes.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Not laser eyes, but we have a "Distor Rex"—a deformed, mutant Tyrannosaurus Rex with six limbs!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Six limbs! Okay, that's something. But why are we going to this island? Did someone forget their car keys there? Because I swear, every time we go back to an island, it's for the flimsiest reason. Like saving Blue. Remember Blue? Everyone loves Blue.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** A pharmaceutical company needs DNA samples! From the three most dangerous creatures on land, sea, and air! They say it's for a revolutionary, life-saving drug!

**PRODUCER GUY:** (Snorts) "Life-saving drug." Sure. And I'm sure it's not at all to make more super dinosaurs to sell as weapons. Because that's never happened before. Never.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It's a heist movie, Producer Guy! With Scarlett Johansson leading a team of covert ops experts! And Mahershala Ali as her right-hand man! They're getting paid a lot of money to go get this dino-DNA.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Scarlett Johansson, huh? She's good. Can she wrestle a Spinosaurus? Because the fans loved when the Spinosaurus broke the T-Rex's neck. That was a *moment*.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** There's also a shipwrecked civilian family who gets stranded on the island! Because we need that element of relatable, innocent people getting chased by giant lizards. It's in the franchise DNA! Also, we're bringing back a raft sequence from the original book that never made it into the first movie!

**PRODUCER GUY:** A raft sequence! So, like, a really big bath toy floating around with a T-Rex trying to eat them? I mean, it sounds… wet. And bitey.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** And we're going for a tone that's more like the original *Jurassic Park*! More awe, more wonder, more horror! Less… giant locusts.

**PRODUCER GUY:** (Nods slowly, putting down his golf club) Less giant locusts. I like the sound of that. And less Chris Pratt making promises to baby raptors, hopefully. So, we're going back to basics. Dangerous island, greedy corporation, people getting eaten by things with very big teeth. It's almost like we've done this before. But with a six-limbed T-Rex. You know what? It just might work.
