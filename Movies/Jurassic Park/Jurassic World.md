## INT. STUDIO EXECUTIVE'S OFFICE - DAY

PRODUCER GUY sits across from SCREENWRITER GUY, who holds a stack of papers.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, what's this new idea you've got for me? Another dinosaur movie? Because, and hear me out, we did that. Several times.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, yes, but this one is different! It's called *Jurassic World*! And it's set 22 years after the original!

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, people still haven't learned their lesson? Shocking.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, no, they totally learned! They built a fully functioning, wildly successful dinosaur theme park! It's got everything! A petting zoo with baby dinosaurs, a gyrosphere ride where you get up close and personal with herbivores...

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, what's the problem? No movie without a problem. Is it… dinosaurs? Because it feels like it's going to be dinosaurs.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, the park's attendance is… declining. So, they need a new attraction to spice things up!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Right, because what sells more tickets than more dangerous dinosaurs? It's like they're actively trying to get eaten.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly! So, they've genetically engineered a brand new dinosaur! It's bigger, smarter, and has more teeth! It's called the Indominus Rex!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Indominus Rex? Is that Latin for "Oops, we made a monster"?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** (Beaming) Something like that! It's a hybrid of T-Rex, raptor, cuttlefish, tree frog, and a whole bunch of other stuff!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Cuttlefish? So it can change its skin color? And a tree frog? So it can climb? This is just getting ridiculous. Why would you give a gigantic, flesh-eating monster camouflage and climbing abilities? What's the upside here?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Uh, marketability? It's the ultimate predator! And it's so smart, it can even communicate with the raptors!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wait, so you're telling me this thing escapes, and then it *convinces* the other trained raptors, the ones that the main character has a special bond with, to turn on the humans?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes! It's a shocking betrayal!

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, this smart, camouflage-climbing, raptor-whispering dinosaur gets out, and the park security tries to subdue it with *non-lethal* weapons? When it's already killed a bunch of people?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, it's a multi-million dollar asset! You can't just blow it up!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, right, because a few dead tourists are cheaper than a destroyed dinosaur. Makes sense. And then the park manager's nephews get lost in all this chaos? And they find the *old* visitor center from the original park?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes! It's a fun callback! And then they fix up an old Jeep and drive it back to the park!

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, two kids, who probably don't have driver's licenses, just happen to be expert mechanics and get an ancient, derelict vehicle running in the middle of a dinosaur apocalypse? Riveting. And at the end, how do they stop the Indominus Rex? Do they finally use a tank or something?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Oh no, that would be too simple. The park manager, who's been running around in high heels the entire time, lures the original T-Rex out of its enclosure to fight the Indominus Rex!

**PRODUCER GUY:** So the solution to one rampaging dinosaur is… another rampaging dinosaur? Brilliant! And then the Mosasaurus, the giant aquatic dinosaur, just pops out of the water and eats the Indominus Rex? Just like that?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, it was a surprise attack! Nobody saw it coming!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Except for anyone who saw the giant Mosasaurus in the marketing. Look, I get it. Big dinosaurs, bigger chaos. People love that. I think this could actually do really well.

**PRODUCER GUY:** (Stares intently at Screenwriter Guy) So, you're telling me, after all this, we leave the island abandoned with all the surviving dinosaurs still running around?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah! It sets up the sequel!

**PRODUCER GUY:** You beautiful, crazy genius.
