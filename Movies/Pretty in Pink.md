**PRODUCER GUY:** So you have a new teen romance movie for me?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes sir, I do. It's written by John Hughes, the guy who knows what teenagers are.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, the guy who thinks all teenagers hang out with a diverse group of archetypes in Saturday detention? Love his work.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** That's the one! So this movie is called *Pretty in Pink*.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Okay, so it’s about a girl who is pretty and also wears pink. Got it. Very high concept.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly! So our main character is Andie. She's from the poor side of town, lives with her sad, underemployed dad, and she expresses herself by making her own very… unique clothes.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So she's a fashion visionary?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Let's say her clothes have a lot of personality. Lots of lace and flowery patterns all mashed together. Anyway, her best friend is this guy named Duckie, and he is hopelessly in love with her.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Ah, the classic friendzone character. Is he going to spend the whole movie making grand romantic gestures that go completely unnoticed?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He sure is! He's super eccentric, has amazing hair, and at one point he's going to do an elaborate, full-throated lip-sync performance of Otis Redding's "Try a Little Tenderness" right in the middle of the record store where Andie works.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wow. A public display of unrequited love that will surely not make everyone, including the object of his affection, deeply uncomfortable. That's a bold move.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It is! But Andie has her eyes on a different guy: a rich, popular kid named Blane. He's not like the other rich kids, though. He's sensitive.

**PRODUCER GUY:** How do we know he's sensitive? Does he drive a slightly less expensive BMW?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, he thinks Andie is cool and asks her out, even though his best friend Steff is a complete and total jerk about it.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Why is Steff such a jerk?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, it turns out he's secretly attracted to Andie, but she rejected him, so now his plan is to be an insufferable snob for the rest of the movie.

**PRODUCER GUY:** The ol' "my fragile ego is hurt so I must become a monster" strategy. A true classic of teen cinema.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So Blane asks Andie to the prom, and she's super excited. But then, under pressure from Steff, Blane gets cold feet and starts ghosting her. He eventually calls and cancels, making up a lame excuse.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A spineless rich kid who caves to peer pressure? I'm shocked. Truly.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Andie is heartbroken, but her dad gives her a pep talk and she decides to go to the prom by herself to show them she's not ashamed of who she is! And she's going to make her own prom dress!

**PRODUCER GUY:** And I assume this dress is going to be a stunning masterpiece that makes everyone regret ever doubting her?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It's going to be very, very pink. And kind of shapeless. Some might describe it as an off-the-shoulder polka-dotted sack.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Fantastic. So she shows up alone in a weird dress. This sounds like a recipe for a great night.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, Duckie shows up to be her date! He escorts her in, but then they see Blane is there with another girl. Andie is about to leave, but Duckie, in a moment of true friendship, sees how much she loves Blane and tells her to go to him.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wait a minute. After pining for her for the entire movie, his big move is to push her into the arms of the cowardly rich dude who publicly humiliated her?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It's a noble sacrifice, sir!

**PRODUCER GUY:** A noble sacrifice is tight!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So Andie confronts Blane in the hallway. He apologizes profusely and admits he was a coward and that he's always loved her.

**PRODUCER GUY:** And she's just going to forgive him immediately after he crushed her heart?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Actually, it's going to be super easy, barely an inconvenience.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, really?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah, see, all he has to do is say, "I love you," and then they kiss passionately in the parking lot. The end.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So the moral is that being treated like garbage is fine as long as the guy is handsome and apologizes in a parking lot. What about Duckie? What happens to him?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He sees a random girl at the prom who smiles at him, so he's fine now.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wow, his years of emotional investment were resolved in seconds. Efficient.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It is! What do you think?

**PRODUCER GUY:** A story about class warfare, questionable fashion choices, and a guy named Duckie sounds like something teenagers will eat up. This will be a classic people talk about for decades.
