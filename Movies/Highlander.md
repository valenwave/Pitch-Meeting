**PRODUCER GUY:** So, you have an epic fantasy movie for me?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes sir, I do! It’s called *Highlander*, and it’s about a bunch of immortals who have been secretly fighting each other for centuries.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, a secret war between ancient beings! Those are tight!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** They are! So our hero is Connor MacLeod, a Scotsman born in the Highlands of Scotland in the year 1518.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Love it. A rugged Scottish hero. I assume we’re getting a charismatic Scottish actor for the part?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** We’re getting Christopher Lambert, a French actor whose English is, uh, let’s call it unique.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A Frenchman is playing the quintessential Scotsman. Is his accent going to be a problem?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Not at all, it will be an iconic part of the character! So in 1536, Connor is in a battle and gets fatally wounded by a massive, terrifying warrior known as The Kurgan.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So he dies. Is this a short film?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, see, he comes back to life perfectly fine! So his clan, thinking he’s a demon, banishes him.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Seems like a measured response to a friend miraculously recovering from being shish-kebabbed.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It does. So Connor wanders off and eventually meets another immortal, a wise and flamboyant mentor named Juan Sánchez-Villalobos Ramírez.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A classic Spanish name. I trust we’ve cast a talented Spanish actor for this role?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** We’ve cast Sean Connery.

**PRODUCER GUY:** The Scottish actor.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** That’s the one!

**PRODUCER GUY:** So let me get this straight. The Frenchman is playing the Scotsman, and the Scotsman is playing a Spaniard who is also secretly an ancient Egyptian.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Now you’re getting it! So Ramírez teaches Connor the rules of being an immortal. They can’t die unless their head is cut off.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Decapitation. Very specific weakness.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes! And they’re all part of something called "The Game." They have to fight until only one is left, and the winner gets "The Prize."

**PRODUCER GUY:** What’s The Prize? A really nice sword?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** We’ll find out at the end! So after a fun training montage, The Kurgan finds them and cuts off Ramírez’s head.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh no! Not his vaguely-accented mentor!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It’s very tragic. So then we jump forward to 1985 New York City. Connor is now living under the name Russell Nash and he’s an antique dealer.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Of course he is.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** And The Kurgan is there too! The final immortals are being drawn together for "The Gathering." The movie actually starts with Connor fighting another immortal in a parking garage. After he lops his head off, he absorbs his energy in an event called "The Quickening."

**PRODUCER GUY:** The Quickening, you say. Is that a subtle process?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Not at all! It involves lightning shooting out of the body, windows exploding, and cars going haywire.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So it must be difficult to keep this whole immortal war a secret from the public.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Actually, it’s going to be super easy, barely an inconvenience.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, really?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah, see, a forensic metallurgist named Brenda finds a piece of a 600-year-old sword at the modern crime scene, tracks Connor down, and he just tells her everything. And then they fall in love.

**PRODUCER GUY:** She just accepts that her new boyfriend is a 450-year-old magic Scotsman who fights other magic people for a vague prize?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Pretty much! Meanwhile, The Kurgan is just tearing up New York, driving like a maniac, kidnapping Brenda, and even licking a priest.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Why does he lick a priest?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** To show how evil he is! So it all culminates in a final battle between Connor and The Kurgan. "There can be only one!"

**PRODUCER GUY:** He says the thing!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He does! They have an epic sword fight on a rooftop, and Connor finally cuts off The Kurgan’s head, winning The Game!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Amazing! So he gets The Prize! What is it? What does he win?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He becomes mortal, so he can grow old and die. He also gains the ability to read the minds of every single person on Earth, all at once.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wait, he can hear everyone’s thoughts? All the time? That sounds absolutely horrible. That’s not a prize, that’s a curse! A one-way ticket to a padded cell!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, he can use it to help humanity, maybe. And the whole movie is set to an amazing soundtrack by the rock band Queen!

**PRODUCER GUY:** A French Scotsman, a Scottish Egyptian, constant beheadings, and a Queen soundtrack? It's confusing, ridiculous, and sounds absolutely incredible. This movie is going to be a cult classic!
