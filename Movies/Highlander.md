**PRODUCER GUY:** So, you've got another pitch for me, huh? What's this one about?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Okay, so picture this: Immortals.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Immortals. Like, they don't die?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly! But there's a catch. The only way you can kill an immortal is by chopping off their head.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Right. So, like, a bunch of guys running around with swords, trying to decapitate each other? That sounds... violent. And a little niche.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It's epic! They've been living among us for centuries, secretly fighting. And eventually, "there can be only one!"

**PRODUCER GUY:** "There can be only one." So, a Highlander, from Scotland, is fighting a guy named The Kurgan, who's this big, scary dude who clearly skips leg day.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He's intimidating! And he drives a really cool car.

**PRODUCER GUY:** And Sean Connery is in it, right? Playing... a Spanish Egyptian? With a Scottish accent?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** **WELL, HE'S AN IMMORTAL, SO HE'S BEEN AROUND! AND HE'S WISE! HE TRAINS OUR HERO!**

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, they're fighting in a parking garage. And when one of them gets their head chopped off, all the cars explode for some reason? Like, a mystical energy surge?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** **IT'S CALLED THE QUICKENING! IT'S VERY IMPORTANT! THE ENERGY IS RELEASED!**

**PRODUCER GUY:** Okay. And the main guy, Connor MacLeod, he's like... an antiques dealer in New York now? But he flashes back to medieval Scotland?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** **YES! IT'S ABOUT HIS JOURNEY THROUGH TIME! THE WEIGHT OF ETERNITY! THE LOSS HE'S ENDURED!**

**PRODUCER GUY:** The loss of his first wife, who just... dies of old age because *she* wasn't immortal. That's actually kind of sad. But then he meets this modern woman, a metallurgist, who investigates all the headless bodies. And she finds out his secret pretty quickly, like, by examining sword fragments.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** **SHE'S VERY SMART! SHE'S INTO METALLURGY!**

**PRODUCER GUY:** And then there's a big final showdown in a studio, with all these weird industrial sparks and stuff flying around. And he finally chops off The Kurgan's head and gets "The Prize." What's The Prize, by the way?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** **IT'S ALL THE KNOWLEDGE! ALL THE POWER OF THE IMMORTALS! AND THEN HE CAN HAVE KIDS! HE BECOMES MORTAL!**

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wait, so the prize for being the last immortal is... becoming mortal? So he can have kids? After centuries of fighting to the death?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** **IT'S A METAPHOR! FOR HUMANITY! AND LOVE! AND THE FUTURE!**

**PRODUCER GUY:** Look, this sounds like a lot of sword fighting, some really questionable accents, and a mythology that's... fluid, at best. But you know what? With Queen doing the soundtrack, it's probably going to be a cult classic.
