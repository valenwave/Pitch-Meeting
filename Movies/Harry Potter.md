**PRODUCER GUY:** So you have a movie for me about a magical British boarding school?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes sir, I do! It’s about this young boy who doesn't know he's a wizard.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, a secret wizard! I like it. What's his home life like?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, his parents were murdered by an evil dark wizard when he was a baby. Now he lives with his abusive aunt and uncle who make him sleep in a cupboard under the stairs.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wow, that got dark really fast. So I assume some magical social services will step in to rescue this poor, orphaned child from his cartoonishly evil relatives?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Nope! They just leave him there for ten years. But on his eleventh birthday, the local magic school sends him an acceptance letter.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, good! So his aunt and uncle see the letter and realize he’s destined for greatness and treat him better?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, they try to hide it from him. But the school is very persistent and sends hundreds of letters until they flood the entire house.

**PRODUCER GUY:** That seems wildly inefficient. Couldn't they just send a teacher or something?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** They do! A giant bearded man named Hagrid shows up, breaks down the door, gives the uncle's son a pig's tail for eating the boy's birthday cake, and then tells the boy, "You're a wizard, Harry."

**PRODUCER GUY:** And Harry's just cool with all of this? A strange giant breaks into his house, performs weird magic on his cousin, and tells him he's a wizard?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He’s super cool with it! So Hagrid takes him to a magical alleyway to buy school supplies, including a wand that happens to be the brother of the wand that belonged to the wizard who murdered his parents.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, that’s not ominous at all. So then he goes to the magic school, which I assume is a very safe place for children?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It’s called Hogwarts! And it's mostly safe, except for the giant three-headed dog guarding a trapdoor on a forbidden floor, the troll that gets loose in the dungeons, and the forest on the grounds that's filled with dangerous creatures.

**PRODUCER GUY:** This school sounds like a parental lawsuit waiting to happen.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So Harry makes friends with a boy named Ron and a girl named Hermione, and they immediately suspect one of the teachers, Professor Snape, is trying to steal whatever the giant dog is guarding.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, a classic whodunnit. So they report their suspicions to the headmaster, Albus Dumbledore, who is famously wise and powerful?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Nope, they decide to handle it themselves. Dumbledore gets conveniently lured away from the school, so these three eleven-year-olds decide it’s up to them to protect the magical object.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So it’s going to be tough for three first-year students to get past a series of powerful magical enchantments set up by the school's most powerful teachers.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Actually, it’s going to be super easy, barely an inconvenience.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, really?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah, see, the first challenge is a plant that hates sunlight, which the super-smart girl knows how to defeat. Then there’s a room full of flying keys, and Harry just so happens to be an amazing broomstick flyer. Then there’s a giant game of wizard's chess, and Ron is great at chess, so he sacrifices himself so they can win.

**PRODUCER GUY:** He sacrifices himself? A child dies in this movie? Wow wow wow.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Oh, he's fine, just gets knocked out. So Harry goes on alone and finds out it wasn't Snape trying to steal the thing after all. It was the timid, stuttering Professor Quirrell.

**PRODUCER GUY:** The old switcheroo! So Quirrell is the big bad?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He is! And also, he's been sharing his body with the dark wizard Voldemort, who appears as a face on the back of Quirrell's head.

**PRODUCER GUY:** He has a... what now? There’s a face on the back of his head?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** A face on the back of his head. So Voldemort orders Quirrell to kill Harry, but when Quirrell touches him, his skin burns and he crumbles into dust.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Why does he turn to dust?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Because Harry is protected by his mother’s love.

**PRODUCER GUY:** The power of love makes bad guys disintegrate. Got it. So the day is saved, and I bet there’s a big celebration.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** There is! At the end-of-year feast, the Slytherin house is about to win the House Cup, but then Dumbledore shows up and starts awarding a ton of last-minute points to Harry and his friends for breaking all the rules. Gryffindor wins the cup, and all the other houses celebrate that Slytherin lost.

**PRODUCER GUY:** That seems incredibly biased and teaches children that rules don't matter if you're the main character. I love it! It's a story about magic, friendship, and blatant favoritism. This is gonna be huge.
