Sure, here is the pitch meeting for the movie *The Hunger Games*:
## Pitch Meeting: The Hunger Games

**INT. STUDIO EXECUTIVE OFFICE - DAY**

PRODUCER GUY sits across from SCREENWRITER GUY, who holds a thick manuscript.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, what's the big idea?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Okay, so it's a dystopian future, right? North America is now this country called Panem, and it's divided into a super rich Capitol and twelve impoverished districts.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Uh-huh. And?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** And as a punishment for a past rebellion, every year, each district has to send two of their kids – a boy and a girl – to fight to the death in a televised event called the Hunger Games!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Whoa, whoa, whoa. Kids fighting to the death? On TV? Isn't that... a little dark?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It's for a young adult audience! It's super edgy! And it's a critique of reality television and governmental oppression! It's got layers!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Right, layers. So, what's our hook? Who's our hero?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** We follow Katniss Everdeen. She's from District 12, the poorest district, where people are literally starving. Her little sister, Prim, gets chosen for the Games, and Katniss volunteers to take her place.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Okay, a selfless hero. I like it. So, she's going to win, right? Because she's the protagonist.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, she's gonna try. She's really good with a bow and arrow because she hunts for her family.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A bow and arrow, you say? Very on brand for a young adult heroine. So, what happens in these games? Is it like a big arena?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Oh, it's a massive, elaborate arena, and the Gamemakers can control everything in it! They can unleash genetically engineered animals, start forest fires, drain lakes... it's basically a giant playground of death for their entertainment.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, basically, *The Running Man* meets *Battle Royale*, but with teenagers.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Uh, no, it's completely original. Anyway, Katniss has to deal with other tributes, including these "Careers" who have been training their whole lives for this. And there's also Peeta, the other tribute from her district. He's a baker.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A baker? Can he fight?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Not really, but he's good at camouflaging himself like a rock. And he's in love with Katniss!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, a love triangle! Smart. The kids love a good love triangle. So, she's trying to win, but also falling in love?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah, it gets complicated. Especially when the Gamemakers introduce a rule change that two tributes from the same district can win. So, Katniss and Peeta team up! And they fake a romance to get sponsors!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wait, so they're faking it for the cameras? That's... surprisingly cynical for a young adult book. I love it! So, they both win, and everything's great?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, not exactly. The Gamemakers revoke the rule change at the last minute, so only one of them can win.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, no! What a twist! So, one of them has to kill the other?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Nope! Katniss pulls out some poisonous berries, and they threaten to eat them together, basically saying "if we die, there's no victor for you."

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, they're blackmailing the Capitol? With berries?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It's a symbolic act of defiance! It shows the Capitol that they don't own them! And it works! They both win!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Brilliant! So, a feel-good ending where they stick it to the man! This is going to be huge. We'll cast some fresh faces, get a good director, and people will flock to see kids fighting to the death! It's super easy, barely an inconvenience.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Actually, it sets up for some pretty intense sequels where she becomes the face of a rebellion.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Details, details! I'm talking about this first one. This is gonna make us some serious money.
