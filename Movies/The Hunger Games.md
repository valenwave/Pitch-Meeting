**PRODUCER GUY:** So, you have a Young Adult movie for me?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes sir, I do. It’s based on a super popular book series, so a bunch of the work is already done.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, capitalizing on a built-in fanbase is tight! So what’s it about? A moody girl who falls in love with a sparkly vampire?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Close! It’s about a moody girl who’s forced into a televised fight to the death with other children.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh… for kids! That’s unexpected. Tell me more.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So we’re in this dystopian country called Panem, which is run by the super-rich Capitol. As punishment for a rebellion that happened a long time ago, every year they hold an event called the Hunger Games.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Let me guess, it’s not actually a game and there’s very little food involved.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** You are correct, sir. They take one boy and one girl from each of the twelve districts and put them in a giant arena to kill each other until only one is left alive.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So it’s a battle royale with teenagers. Why hasn’t anyone thought of this before? It’s brilliant!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Right? And our main character is Katniss Everdeen. When her 12-year-old sister, Primrose, gets picked at the lottery, Katniss volunteers to take her place.

**PRODUCER GUY:** What a great sister! Sacrificing herself like that. So she goes into the arena and dies immediately, roll credits?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, no, she's actually a really good hunter with a bow and arrow, so she's got a fighting chance. The boy from her district is Peeta Mellark, the baker's son.

**PRODUCER GUY:** What’s his special skill? Throwing rock-hard sourdough at people?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Not quite. But during the pre-game interviews, he confesses that he’s had a massive crush on Katniss for years.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, a pre-murder-game romance declaration. Bold strategy. Let’s see if it pays off for him.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It does! It gets them a ton of sponsors. They're called the "star-crossed lovers." They even get a mentor, Haymitch, who won the games years ago.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So he’ll be their wise old trainer who guides them to victory.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He’s mostly just a surly drunk who tells them to get people to like them.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, fantastic. So the games start and it’s an absolute bloodbath right away. Katniss wisely runs into the woods to hide.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly. And at one point, she’s treed by a group of the meaner tributes, so she cuts down a nest of genetically engineered wasps called Tracker Jackers and drops it on them.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Genetically engineered murder hornets are super tight! What happens when you get stung?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** You have terrifying hallucinations and can possibly die. One of the girls who gets stung, Glimmer, dies from it.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wow wow wow wow. So this movie is just piling up the dead kids.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It sure is! Then the Gamemakers, the people running the show, announce a rule change: two people from the same district can win together.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, so the producers are shipping Katniss and Peeta, too. I get it.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So Katniss finds Peeta, who is badly injured, and they hide out in a cave. She plays up the romance angle to get sponsors to send them medicine.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Faking a relationship for clout and free stuff? This movie is just like real life!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So they survive, and eventually, it’s just them and one other guy, Cato, left. They have a big fight and Cato gets thrown to a pack of vicious mutant dogs. Katniss shoots him with an arrow to put him out of his misery.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A mercy killing. How thoughtful in a movie about kids killing kids. So they win!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Not quite! The Gamemakers revoke the rule change and say there can only be one winner.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Those sneaky TV producers! You can’t trust them.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** You can’t. But Katniss has a plan. She pulls out a handful of deadly poisonous berries called nightlock and gives half to Peeta. They’re going to eat them at the same time, leaving the games with no winner.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, an ultimatum! Is it going to be hard for her to pull this off?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Actually, it’s going to be super easy. Barely an inconvenience.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, really?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah, the Gamemakers panic and announce that they are both the winners right before they can eat the berries. So they go home as heroes.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Amazing! But I’m sensing the head of the TV network, President Snow, is not going to be happy about being publicly outsmarted by a teenager.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He is not, sir. She basically lit the spark of a rebellion.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So there’s going to be a sequel?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** There are going to be three more movies, sir. And we’re splitting the last book in two.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Of course you are. Money is tight. I love it! A violent YA story about child murder that will spawn a massive global franchise. What could go wrong?
