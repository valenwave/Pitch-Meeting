Screenwriter Guy: So, I have this idea for a movie. It’s a social commentary, you know, really deep stuff.

Producer Guy: Oh, goodie! Another one of those. Is it gonna have, like, a single tear rolling down a child’s face while a slow-motion shot of a flower withers? Because I'm in if it has that.

Screenwriter Guy: No, no, it’s much more visceral. It’s set in this vertical prison, and there’s a platform…

Producer Guy: A platform? Like, a social media platform? Are we doing a TikTok movie now? Because I’m pretty sure that’s already been done. And failed. Miserably.

Screenwriter Guy: No, it’s a *literal* platform. It descends through hundreds of levels, and on this platform is food. Delicious food.

Producer Guy: Okay, I’m listening. Is it, like, a buffet that goes down? Because I could get behind that. Imagine, all-you-can-eat, delivered right to your cell! Though, I feel like some people would just hoard the mini quiches.

Screenwriter Guy: Well, that’s the thing! The people on the upper levels get to eat first, and by the time it reaches the lower levels… there’s nothing left.

Producer Guy: Oh! So, it’s like a commentary on capitalism! Very subtle. Is there also a scene where someone tries to explain socialism and then gets eaten by a giant, sentient pile of avocado toast? Because I feel like that's where this is going.

Screenwriter Guy: Not exactly. But there’s a lot of, um, *creative* ways people try to survive. Like, one guy tries to ration food, another tries to send a message…

Producer Guy: A message? Like, a text message? Is there cell service in this vertical prison? Because I feel like that would defeat the whole "desperate struggle for survival" vibe. Unless it's, like, dial-up internet, then that's just a different kind of torture.

Screenwriter Guy: No, it’s a literal message. They try to send a panacotta back up to the top, untouched, to prove a point.

Producer Guy: A panacotta? You're telling me, with all the hunger and desperation, they’re going to preserve a *panacotta*? Is this a Michelin star prison? Because I feel like if I was starving, that panacotta would be gone before you could say "existential dread."

Screenwriter Guy: And then, the main character… he goes down the levels, to try and change the system. He even teams up with a woman who's looking for her daughter.

Producer Guy: Okay, so a buddy cop movie, but in a vertical prison, with a panacotta as the McGuffin. I like it. Does the panacotta get its own dramatic monologue? Because I feel like it deserves one.

Screenwriter Guy: It's all about human nature, and how people react under pressure, and… cannibalism.

Producer Guy: Cannibalism! *Chef's kiss*! You had me at panacotta, but you sealed the deal with the cannibalism. So, it's a commentary on class, with a side of delicious human flesh. This is going to be a hit!
