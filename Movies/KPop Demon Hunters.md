**PRODUCER GUY:** So, what's the pitch?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Okay, so it's an animated movie. And it's about a K-Pop girl group.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, cool. Like, a concert movie? Or they go on tour and find themselves?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, no, no. They're also demon hunters.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wait, so they're, like, singing on stage, and then they fight demons? In between songs?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah, exactly! They use their singing voices to create magical barriers and their dance moves are, like, martial arts. And their concerts are actually rituals to seal away demons.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, they're, like, doing a high note, and then *bam*, a demon gets punched? And they're still in their elaborate stage outfits?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, yeah, they're always in fashion. It's K-Pop! And get this, the main girl, Rumi, has a secret. She's half-demon.

**PRODUCER GUY:** (Raises an eyebrow) Half-demon? So she's fighting her own kind? That'sâ€¦ a little on the nose, isn't it? Is she, like, conflicted? Does she have a brooding, mysterious demon boyfriend?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Funny you should ask! There's a rival K-Pop boy band, the Saja Boys, and they're secretly demons sent by the big bad, Gwi-Ma. And the leader of that group, Jinu, he forms a connection with Rumi.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So it's a K-Pop romance between a half-demon girl and a full-on demon boy, who are trying to destroy each other's careers... and maybe the world? Sounds a little dramatic for an animated film about pop stars.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, there's a lot of emotional depth! Rumi is ashamed of her heritage, and Jinu has his own tragic backstory about how he became a demon. And their music reflects their internal struggles! They even have a song called "Golden" which is about unity, but then they have to write "Takedown" to expose the Saja Boys.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So they're, like, writing diss tracks against demons? And the demons are, what, draining the fans' energy with their own catchy songs? This is... surprisingly meta.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It's genius! And it's rooted in Korean folklore! The demon hunters are like ancient shamans, using song and dance to protect the world. And the demons are inspired by traditional masks.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, it's culturally rich, has K-Pop, demon fighting, a forbidden romance, and probably a cute sidekick or two, right? A little tiger-magpie duo?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** We've got a crow and a derpy tiger! They're adorable mascots!

**PRODUCER GUY:** (Sighs, then a slow grin spreads across his face) You know what? This is insane. It's completely bonkers. K-Pop and demon hunting? Who would've thought? But it's got... a certain charm to it. Like a fever dream you want to keep having. Yeah, I think this could actually do really well.
