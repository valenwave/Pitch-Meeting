**PRODUCER GUY:** So, you’ve got a movie for me?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes sir, I do. Get ready for this, it’s an animated musical action-comedy called K-Pop: Demon Hunters.

**PRODUCER GUY:** K-Pop… Demon Hunters. It sounds like two ideas you pulled out of a hat. What’s next, Amish Sci-Fi Romance?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** I’ll write that down. But this is great! It’s about a world-famous K-Pop girl group called HUNTR/X. They sell out stadiums, top the charts, and in their spare time, they hunt demons.

**PRODUCER GUY:** They moonlight as demon hunters? How does that even work with their schedule? Isn't being a K-Pop idol like a 24/7 job of practicing, promoting, and avoiding scandals?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** They make it work. See, for generations, a trio of female warriors has used their singing voices to maintain a magical barrier called the Honmoon, which keeps demons from taking over the world. HUNTR/X is just the latest trio in that lineage.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So their singing literally saves the world.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly! And they’re super close to finally strengthening the barrier into a Golden Honmoon, which would seal the demons away forever. But the lead singer, Rumi, is starting to lose her voice.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh no, vocal strain from too many concerts?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Nope, it’s because she’s secretly part demon herself.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wow wow wow… wow. The demon hunter is part demon? That’s a classic trope. Is she going to be all angsty about it?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Just a little. Her foster mom, who was a previous hunter, told her that turning the Honmoon gold would erase her demon marks, so she's super motivated. Anyway, the big demon king, Gwi-Ma, is getting desperate, so he creates a rival K-Pop *boy band* made of demons to steal their fans and weaken the Honmoon.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A demon boy band. Of course. So the whole plot is a battle of the bands for the fate of the world?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** You get it! The demon group is called the Saja Boys, and their lead singer, Jinu, is this super handsome bad boy who used to be human. He sold his soul for a great voice to help his family out of poverty, but then Gwi-Ma twisted the deal.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So he’s a sympathetic demon. And let me guess, he and the half-demon lead singer are going to have a little star-crossed romance thing going on?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It’s a very nuanced and complicated relationship! They meet and he discovers her secret demon marks, but he helps hide them. He tells her Gwi-Ma controls demons through feelings of shame, and talking with him actually heals her voice!

**PRODUCER GUY:** So their connection helps her sing better to destroy all demons, including him. That’s not going to be awkward at all.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It gets worse! The Saja Boys get super popular, and HUNTR/X decides to write a diss track called "Takedown" to expose them at the Idol Awards. But Gwi-Ma is one step ahead. He has demon imposters replace the other two members of HUNTR/X on stage, and they trick Rumi into performing "Takedown," but instead of exposing the Saja Boys, they expose Rumi’s demon marks to the whole world!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, that is a PR nightmare. Her bandmates must be pretty upset.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** They feel super betrayed. So now Rumi is alone, the Honmoon is weaker than ever, and Gwi-Ma casts a trance on everyone to lure them to the Saja Boys’ final concert where he’ll break the barrier completely. Rumi is so devastated she asks her foster mom to just end her life.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Yikes, this got dark. It’s going to be tough to come back from that.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Actually, it’s going to be super easy, barely an inconvenience.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, really?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah, see, Rumi decides not to give up. She crashes the Saja Boys’ performance with a brand new song about self-acceptance and embracing your flaws. It’s so powerful it breaks Gwi-Ma’s trance, her bandmates forgive her immediately, and they all reunite to fight.

**PRODUCER GUY:** They just needed to hear a catchy song about her feelings?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** A very catchy song. And then, Jinu feels super guilty for tricking her, so he sacrifices himself to save Rumi from Gwi-Ma, which gives her a huge power-up. Then the newly empowered HUNTR/X just totally beats up Gwi-Ma and the Saja Boys and saves the day.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So a diss track almost destroyed them, but a power ballad about self-love saved everything. I guess that makes sense for K-Pop.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It’s a metaphor! The real demons are our inner shame and guilt.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A K-Pop group fighting metaphorical demons with hit singles. You know what? The soundtrack alone will make a fortune. I love it.
