**PRODUCER GUY:** So you have a movie for me?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes sir, I do. It’s a buddy comedy, but get this: the buddies are toys. And they come to life when people aren't around.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Toys that are alive. I feel like that could be either very charming or incredibly terrifying.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Charming! Definitely charming. So our main character is Woody, a classic pull-string cowboy doll. He’s the favorite toy of his owner, a kid named Andy, and he’s the leader of all the toys in the bedroom.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Got it. King of the castle.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly. But then it’s Andy’s birthday, and he gets a brand new, super cool action figure: Buzz Lightyear, a Space Ranger! He’s got wings, a laser, a button that makes him talk… all the bells and whistles.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, so the old classic gets shown up by the new hotness. A tale as old as time.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** You know it. And here’s the twist: Buzz doesn’t know he’s a toy. He genuinely believes he’s a real Space Ranger who has crash-landed on a strange planet.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wait, what? How does he not know he’s a toy? It says "Made in Taiwan" on his butt, doesn't it?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, he’s very committed to his backstory. He thinks his box is a spaceship and tries to contact Star Command.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So he’s delusional. Our hero is delusional. Great.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It’s part of his charm! Anyway, Woody gets super jealous because Andy is playing with Buzz all the time. So, Woody tries to knock Buzz behind a desk so Andy will take him to Pizza Planet instead.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A little light sabotage. I like it.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** But it goes wrong and he accidentally knocks Buzz out the window!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh my god! So he just straight up tries to murder him?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It was an accident! But the other toys don’t see it that way. They think Woody did it on purpose and turn on him. So Woody and Buzz end up getting lost and captured by the evil next-door neighbor, Sid.

**PRODUCER GUY:** And what's this Sid kid's deal?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Oh, he’s a budding pyromaniac who likes to torture toys for fun. He blows them up, takes them apart, and reassembles them into these horrifying mutant creatures.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So we’ve got a child sadist in our charming kids' movie. Fantastic.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It creates stakes! So Sid gets his hands on Buzz and straps a giant rocket to his back, planning to blow him to smithereens.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Yikes. So Buzz is toast.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, this is where Woody has his big hero moment. He realizes he has to save Buzz, so he teams up with all of Sid’s creepy mutant toys. They decide to break the number one rule of being a toy.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Which is?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** They come to life right in front of Sid! They crawl out of the woodwork, all creepy-like, and Woody talks to him, telling him to be nice to his toys. Sid freaks out and runs away screaming.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wow wow wow… wow. So they can just reveal they’re alive whenever they want? Why don’t they do that all the time? Seems like it would solve a lot of problems.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It was a very desperate situation! So now they’ve escaped Sid, but Andy’s family is moving! They have to chase the moving truck.

**PRODUCER GUY:** An action-packed finale!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** You bet! They manage to get the remote control car, RC, out of the truck to rescue Buzz, but then the other toys, still thinking Woody is a murderer, throw *him* out of the truck! But they eventually see Buzz is with him and try to help. But oh no, RC's batteries run out!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh man, it’s going to be tough for them to catch up now.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Actually, it’s going to be super easy, barely an inconvenience.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, really?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah, see, Woody remembers the rocket on Buzz’s back. He lights the fuse, and it sends them flying through the air at incredible speed! Buzz deploys his wings to cut them free just before the rocket explodes, and they glide gracefully through the air, landing perfectly through the sunroof of Andy’s mom’s car, right into a box next to Andy.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So they just happen to fly and land exactly where they need to be.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** That’s the magic of cinema, sir! So Woody and Buzz are best friends now, and everyone is happy. Then, at Christmas, the toys are listening in on the presents, and Andy gets a puppy. Woody and Buzz just share a worried look. End of movie.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A computer-animated movie about talking toys who have deep existential crises and face off against a child psychopath. It’s weird, but I think it might just work. People love watching toys.
