**PRODUCER GUY:** So you have a new animated Disney movie for me?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes sir, I do! It's about a magical family in Colombia.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, magical families are tight! Do they solve magical crimes or something?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Not really. They just live in a magical house, called the Casita, which is alive. And everyone in the family gets a magical gift when they turn five from a magic candle.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A sentient house powered by a magic candle. I have no notes so far. So what’s the main character’s gift?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, that’s the thing. The main character, Mirabel, doesn’t have a gift.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, so she's the family disappointment.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** In the eyes of her Abuela, yes. Big time. See, her sister Luisa has super strength and carries all the town’s burdens, literally. And her other sister Isabela is perfect and can make flowers bloom everywhere.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So one sister is a weightlifter and the other is a walking potpourri bag. What about the others?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well her mom can heal people with her cooking, her aunt Pepa’s mood controls the weather, her cousin Dolores has super-hearing, and her other cousin Camilo is a shapeshifter.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Super hearing sounds like a nightmare. You'd hear everything. Every secret, every bathroom noise...

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It is very difficult for her, yes. So anyway, during the ceremony for the youngest cousin, Antonio, who gets the power to talk to animals, Mirabel sees the Casita starting to crack and the magic candle is flickering!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh no! The magic is in trouble!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It sure is. But when she tells everyone, the cracks disappear and nobody believes her. Her Abuela tells her to stop making everything about her and to just stay out of the way.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Ouch. Grandma is harsh.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Super harsh. So Mirabel decides she has to save the magic herself. She overhears her super-hearing cousin talking about her mysterious Uncle Bruno, who disappeared years ago.

**PRODUCER GUY:** And what's his deal?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He could see the future, but all his predictions were bad so everyone hated him for it. And there’s a whole rule about him.

**PRODUCER GUY:** What’s that?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** We don’t talk about Bruno.

**PRODUCER GUY:** But we’re going to sing a massive song about him that gets stuck in everyone’s head forever, right?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Oh, absolutely. It's going to be a global phenomenon.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Fantastic.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So Mirabel goes into Bruno’s forbidden tower and finds his last vision: it shows her standing in front of the Casita as it breaks apart. So now she thinks she’s the cause of all the problems.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So she is the family disappointment after all.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It would seem so! Then she talks to her super-strong sister Luisa, who sings a whole song about how she’s cracking under the pressure of everyone’s expectations.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A song about crippling anxiety? Kids are going to love this!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** They will! And as she sings, her powers start to flicker. Then Mirabel finds out Bruno is still in the house, living in the walls and patching the cracks.

**PRODUCER GUY:** He’s been living inside the walls this whole time? That’s not creepy at all.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He’s just a socially awkward guy with rats for friends. Anyway, he has another vision that shows the only way to save the magic is for Mirabel to hug her perfect sister, Isabela.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A hug? That’s going to be tough to pull off.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Actually, it’s super easy, barely an inconvenience.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, really?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah, she finds Isabela and they get into an argument, which accidentally causes Isabela to create a cactus instead of a perfect rose. Turns out Isabela is sick of being perfect all the time! They hug it out, and start growing all sorts of weird, imperfect plants.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So embracing imperfection saves the day?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Nope! Abuela sees them and gets furious at Mirabel for making Isabela imperfect. She blames Mirabel for all the family’s problems, and they have a huge fight.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Yikes.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** And as they argue, the magic candle finally dies and the entire house collapses, leaving the family powerless.

**PRODUCER GUY:** The house is dead! Oh no! The sentient real estate is gone!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Mirabel runs away, but Abuela finds her at the river where the family’s tragedy began—where her husband was killed protecting them as they fled their home.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wow, that got dark really fast.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Super dark. So Abuela explains her trauma and fear of losing everything is why she was so hard on the family. They reconcile, and then the whole family shows up, along with all the townspeople, to help them rebuild the house.

**PRODUCER GUY:** It must be pretty hard for a bunch of regular people to rebuild a giant magical mansion.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Not at all. They get it done with a fun musical montage. Then Mirabel is given a doorknob, she puts it in the front door, and BOOM! The magic is back, the house is alive again, and everyone has their powers again!

**PRODUCER GUY:** So the magic was the friends they made along the way?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** And the love of family, yes!

**PRODUCER GUY:** And Mirabel gets a cool power now too, right?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Nope. Still nothing. But she’s the one who holds the family together, so that’s kind of her power.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So her power is just being a good person. Well, I guess that works. A movie about generational trauma with some absolute banger songs. I think people are going to eat this up.
