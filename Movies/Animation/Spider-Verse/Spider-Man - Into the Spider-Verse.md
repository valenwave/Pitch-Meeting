**PRODUCER GUY:** So, you have another superhero movie for me?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes sir, I do! It’s a Spider-Man movie.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Another one? We just did one of those. Are we rebooting it again already?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Kinda! So this one is animated and it’s about a new Spider-Man named Miles Morales.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A new Spider-Man? The audience loves Peter Parker, changing it up is risky.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Oh, don’t you worry, Peter Parker is in it. In fact, multiple Peter Parkers are in it.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Multiple? What does that even mean?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So, our main character is this kid, Miles. He’s a cool Brooklyn teen who gets bitten by a radioactive spider in the subway.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A classic origin story. I like it.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly! So he gets these spider-powers, but he’s super awkward and can’t control them. At one point he gets his hand stuck in his new classmate Gwen’s hair. It’s a whole thing.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Awkward teen romance is tight!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So then Miles goes back to the subway where he was bitten and stumbles upon the actual Spider-Man fighting the Green Goblin next to this giant machine.

**PRODUCER GUY:** The Green Goblin! He’s a classic villain.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** But this Green Goblin is like a giant dragon-monster version.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, even better!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So Spider-Man gets super hurt and gives Miles a USB drive to shut down the machine, which is a supercollider built by the Kingpin.

**PRODUCER GUY:** The Kingpin? The big, bald guy? What’s his deal?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, his wife and son died in a car crash after seeing him about to fight Spider-Man, so now he wants to use the collider to bring back alternate versions of his family from other universes.

**PRODUCER GUY:** That’s… surprisingly tragic for a giant bald man who punches things. But wait, bringing people from other universes? Is that even possible?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It is! But it's also incredibly dangerous and could destroy the city. So, Kingpin kills Spider-Man.

**PRODUCER GUY:** He what now?! You can't kill Spider-Man!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** We do! But then Miles meets another Spider-Man at the grave. This one's a bit older, chubbier, and very jaded. His name is Peter B. Parker.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So there are two Spider-Men now?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Oh, just you wait. So Peter B. Parker agrees to train Miles so they can stop Kingpin. At one point they’re being chased and Miles can’t figure out how to websling, so Peter just throws him off a building.

**PRODUCER GUY:** That seems like a terrible way to teach someone!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It is! But then another Spider-Person shows up to save him, it’s Spider-Gwen! From another dimension!

**PRODUCER GUY:** So that’s the girl whose hair he got stuck in! It’s all coming together! So, is that all the Spider-People?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Not even close. They all go to Aunt May’s house and it turns out she’s sheltering even more of them who got pulled into their dimension. There's Spider-Man Noir, who's a black-and-white 1930s detective.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Okay, that’s… different.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Then there’s Peni Parker, an anime girl with a spider-robot.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A what now?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** And Spider-Ham, who is a cartoon pig.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A cartoon pig Spider-Man? This is the most brilliant thing I’ve ever heard!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So all these Spider-People are glitching out and will die if they stay in this dimension too long. They need to get back to their own universes. But Miles is still struggling with his powers.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So it’s going to be tough for him to step up and be the hero they need.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Actually, it’s going to be super easy, barely an inconvenience.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh really?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah, his dad comes to his dorm room door and gives him a pep talk, and that’s all he needs to master all his powers instantly. He even designs a cool new black and red suit!

**PRODUCER GUY:** A heartfelt speech solves everything! Classic!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So Miles takes a leap of faith off a skyscraper, finally nails the web-swinging, and joins the other Spider-People for a big final battle against Kingpin and his goons.

**PRODUCER GUY:** An epic multiversal superhero showdown! I love it!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** All the Spider-People get sent back to their home dimensions, and Miles defeats Kingpin by using his dad’s words of encouragement to get up after being beaten down.

**PRODUCER GUY:** The power of family! It’s beautiful!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So Miles embraces his role as the one and only Spider-Man of his universe.

**PRODUCER GUY:** This is amazing! A fresh take on Spider-Man, multiple cool-looking characters, a heartfelt story, and incredible animation! This is going to be huge!
