**PRODUCER GUY:** So, you have a sequel to that animated Spider-Man movie for me?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes sir, I do! People absolutely loved the first one, so we’re going to do that again, but like, way more.

**PRODUCER GUY:** More is tight. So what’s it called?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** *Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse*.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, letting everyone know right away that we're going to a bunch of different universes. I like it. So, we'll pick up right where we left off with Miles Morales?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Actually, we’re going to start with Gwen Stacy's backstory for a good chunk of the beginning.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, okay. So, it’s a Gwen Stacy movie?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, no, it's a Miles movie. But we gotta set up that she's feeling all isolated because her dad is hunting her for killing Peter Parker, even though it was an accident.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Cops trying to arrest their super-powered children must be a real downer at family dinners.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It is. Then a Vulture from another dimension shows up, and she has to fight him with the help of Spider-Man 2099 and a pregnant Spider-Woman on a motorcycle.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A pregnant superhero fighting on a motorcycle seems incredibly irresponsible.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Super easy, barely an inconvenience. So then we finally get to Miles, who's struggling with being Spider-Man and being a regular teenager. His parents are getting on his case for being late to his own party.

**PRODUCER GUY:** The classic superhero struggle. So who's the villain this time?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** A guy named The Spot.

**PRODUCER GUY:** What’s his deal?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He’s covered in interdimensional portals. He used to be a scientist at Alchemax and the reason he's like this is because Miles threw a bagel at him during the first movie's climax.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So the entire conflict of this movie is because of a breakfast food?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Pretty much! And The Spot learns he can travel to other universes and absorb power from their colliders, so he starts doing that.

**PRODUCER GUY:** An arms race fueled by particle accelerators. Fun!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So Gwen shows up in Miles’s dimension to track The Spot, and they have a will-they-won’t-they romantic swing through the city. Miles then secretly follows her into a portal to Mumbattan, which is like Manhattan but in India.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Creative.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** There they meet Pavitr Prabhakar, the Spider-Man of that universe, and Hobie Brown, Spider-Punk, who is super cool and anti-establishment. They fight The Spot, but he gets away after causing a “canon event” to almost be disrupted.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A what now?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** A canon event. So Miles gets taken to the Spider-Society headquarters, which is run by Miguel O'Hara, Spider-Man 2099. He explains that every Spider-Person's story has these fixed points, these canon events, like the death of a police captain close to them. If you break one, the universe could collapse.

**PRODUCER GUY:** That sounds like a very restrictive superhero gig. Is there a union for this?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It seems not. And Miguel reveals that Miles' dad is destined to die to save the city, and Miles is not having it.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Understandable. I wouldn’t want my dad to die just to keep the multiverse from having a bad day.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So Miles decides he’s going to save his dad anyway, and the entire Spider-Society starts chasing him.

**PRODUCER GUY:** An entire army of Spider-People against one teenager. It’s going to be tough for him to escape.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Actually, it’s going to be super easy, barely an inconvenience.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, really?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah, he outsmarts and outmaneuvers hundreds of them with relative ease. It's a whole thing.

**PRODUCER GUY:** It sounds like the other Spider-People might need to hit the gym.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So Miles escapes, but the machine that sends people to their home dimension sends him to the dimension the spider that bit him came from, Earth-42.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So he’s in the wrong place?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly. And in this universe, his dad is dead, his Uncle Aaron is alive, and the Miles Morales of this world is the Prowler.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, a cliffhanger! I love those!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yep, the movie just ends there.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wow. Just… wow. So people have to wait for the next movie to see what happens?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** That’s the plan!

**PRODUCER GUY:** A visually stunning, emotionally resonant movie that’s also just half of a story. People are going to love it, but also be furious. I love it!
