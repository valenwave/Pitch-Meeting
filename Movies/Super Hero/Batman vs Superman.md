Sure, here is the Pitch Meeting skit for Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice.
## Pitch Meeting: Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice

**INT. STUDIO EXECUTIVE'S OFFICE - DAY**

PRODUCER GUY is sitting at his desk, scrolling through his phone. SCREENWRITER GUY bursts in, looking excited.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So, I have this idea for our next big superhero movie! It's going to be huge! Two of the biggest superheroes in the world, facing off!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, really? Are we talking, like, a buddy cop movie where they begrudgingly team up? Because that sounds pretty good.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, no, even better! They're going to *fight*!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Fight? Like, a philosophical debate? Or a chess match? Because those are also pretty good.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, like, punch each other! For real! It's Batman versus Superman!

**PRODUCER GUY:** ...But why? Aren't they both good guys?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, see, Batman saw Superman’s fight with Zod in Metropolis and his building got wrecked. So he's really mad about that.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So... Batman is upset about property damage? That seems a bit petty for the Caped Crusader.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, no, it's more than that! He thinks Superman is too powerful, an unchecked alien threat!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Okay, I get that. So, Superman is just going about his business, saving people, and Batman's like, "Nope, too dangerous!"

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly! And then we have Lex Luthor, who’s, like, super manipulative and crazy, and he’s pulling all the strings to make them fight.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, the actual villain is the guy making the good guys fight? Not the good guys actually being villains?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, Lex wants to expose Superman, you know, show humanity that he's not to be trusted. And he uses Kryptonite!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Kryptonite. The thing that literally makes Superman powerless. So Batman just needs a bit of that, and it's game over.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah, but he builds this whole armored suit to fight him, and a kryptonite spear! It's really epic!

**PRODUCER GUY:** A spear. So, he's going to stab him? Batman, the guy who has a strict no-kill rule?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Uh, well, this Batman is a little... darker. He's been doing this for twenty years, he's seen some things.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Twenty years? So he's been Batman for two decades and we're just introducing him now? Seems like we skipped a few movies.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, it's cool! We just jump right in! And then, at the height of their epic battle, when Batman is about to deliver the killing blow, Superman whispers... "Martha."

**PRODUCER GUY:** "Martha"? What, like, he's thinking about his grocery list?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, because Batman’s mom's name was Martha! And Superman’s mom's name is *also* Martha! It brings them together!

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, they were about to kill each other, but then they realize their moms have the same name, and suddenly they're best friends? That's... surprisingly convenient.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It's touching! It's a moment of humanity! And then Wonder Woman shows up!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wait, Wonder Woman is in this too? What is she doing? Is she, like, the referee?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** She's an antiquities dealer! And she's trying to get some encrypted data from Lex Luthor, and she sees the fight, and she's like, "Alright, I guess I'm in!"

**PRODUCER GUY:** So we have Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman... is this a Justice League movie or a Batman/Superman movie?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It's the "Dawn of Justice!" It's setting up the Justice League! And then, because Lex is so crazy, he unleashes Doomsday!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Doomsday? The giant monster that kills Superman? So, our first ever live-action team-up of Batman and Superman ends with Superman dying? In their first movie together?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah! It's bold! It's unexpected! And it makes him a martyr, you know, inspiring the formation of the Justice League.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, we introduce our biggest hero, only to kill him off, just to set up other heroes? And the entire conflict between the two main characters is resolved because their moms have the same first name?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly! It's genius!

**PRODUCER GUY:** You know what? This is so utterly bizarre, it just might work. People are going to be talking about this for years.

**PRODUCER GUY:** I have a good feeling about this one. This is going to be a huge hit. It's got all the ingredients for a billion-dollar movie, easily.
