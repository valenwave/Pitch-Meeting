**Producer Guy:** So, you've got another one of these Marvel shows for Netflix, huh? What's the pitch this time?

**Screenwriter Guy:** Okay, so we've got Jessica Jones. She's a former superhero, but she's not, like, *super* hero-y anymore. She's a private investigator.

**Producer Guy:** Oh, so she's a PI. Like a gritty, noir detective. But with superpowers. So she just, like, punches through walls to find clues?

**Screenwriter Guy:** Well, she *could*, but she mostly uses her super-strength to... open stubborn pickle jars, or break down doors if she's really annoyed. And she's got a serious drinking problem.

**Producer Guy:** A superhero with a drinking problem. Bold! So, what's her big, super-villain problem? Does she fight, like, a guy who makes everyone do the Macarena?

**Screenwriter Guy:** Worse. Much, much worse. She's haunted by a man named Kilgrave. He has the power of mind control. He made her do terrible things. He completely, psychologically tormented her.

**Producer Guy:** Oh. Oh, that's... that's dark. Like, *really* dark. So, it's a superhero show, but it's also a psychological thriller about trauma and abuse?

**Screenwriter Guy:** Exactly! We want to explore the real-world implications of someone with that kind of power, and how it would mess someone up. It's not about punching aliens, it's about inner demons.

**Producer Guy:** Inner demons. Got it. So, how does she fight a guy who can just *tell* her to stop fighting? Does she wear earplugs? A really big hat?

**Screenwriter Guy:** She has to find ways to resist him, to outsmart him. It's a cat-and-mouse game, but the mouse has super strength and a really bad attitude. And he's obsessed with her. Like, *creepily* obsessed.

**Producer Guy:** So, he's like that ex who just won't leave you alone, but he can also make you, like, walk into traffic. That's... genuinely terrifying. Is he purple? In the comics, he's, like, super purple.

**Screenwriter Guy:** No, no purple skin. That might be a bit too... on the nose for the tone we're going for. He's just... a really charismatic, manipulative dude. Played by David Tennant.

**Producer Guy:** David Tennant? Oh, well, that's just cheating. He could make reading the phone book sound menacing. So, she's a PI, she's trying to deal with this incredibly messed-up past, and she's got this super-powered stalker. Does she have, like, a sidekick? A plucky intern who brings her coffee?

**Screenwriter Guy:** She has her foster sister, Trish Walker, who's a radio host. And a neighbor named Malcolm who she initially treats terribly, but he ends up helping her out. And there's Luke Cage!

**Producer Guy:** Luke Cage! The guy with the unbreakable skin! So, he's her, what, love interest? punching bag? Both?

**Screenwriter Guy:** Both, sometimes! Their relationship is... complicated. She accidentally killed his wife while under Kilgrave's control, so, you know, a little baggage there.

**Producer Guy:** A *little* baggage. Just a carry-on, then. So, super-powered PI, alcoholic, PTSD, obsessive mind-controlling ex-villain, unbreakable love interest... this is going to be a real feel-good show, isn't it?

**Screenwriter Guy:** It's going to be honest. And dark. And compelling. And she runs her own detective agency, Alias Investigations. Because, you know, she used to have an alias.

**Producer Guy:** Right, right. Makes sense. So, she's doing detective work, but it's mostly just her trying to survive her own mind while hunting down the ultimate creep. I like it. But is it, like, *Marvel* enough? Does anyone wear, like, a cape? Or, like, a really cool hoodie with a logo?

**Screenwriter Guy:** No capes. Definitely no capes. And her "costume" is usually just a leather jacket and jeans. We're going for realism, not spandex.

**Producer Guy:** Realism. In a world with mind control. You know what? Fine. But if she doesn't, at some point, ironically use her super strength to open a stubborn jar of pickles for dramatic effect, I'm pulling the plug.

**Screenwriter Guy:** Deal.
