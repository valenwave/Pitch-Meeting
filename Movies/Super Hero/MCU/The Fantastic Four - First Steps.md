**PRODUCER GUY:** Alright, so what's the big idea for the *Fantastic Four* reboot? We need something... *fantastic*.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Okay, so it’s *The Fantastic Four: First Steps*. We're jumping straight into it. No origin story! They've already got their powers, they're already a family, they're already famous.

**PRODUCER GUY:** No origin? So, we just... start? Like, "Hey, here are some super-powered people, deal with it"? That's a bold move.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly! It's fresh. We skip the whole "cosmic rays hit us and now we're weird" thing. We open with them having a family dinner, and Sue Storm reveals she's pregnant!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, a baby! So it's a superhero movie, but with baby-proofing the Baxter Building? I'm sensing a strong '60s retro-futuristic vibe here.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Nailed it! Think *The Jetsons* meets Jack Kirby. Lots of bright colors, cool gadgets. And then, bam! The Silver Surfer shows up.

**PRODUCER GUY:** The Silver Surfer! Okay, I'm listening. So, he's like, "Hey guys, the world's about to end, a giant purple guy wants to eat your planet"?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Pretty much! Galactus is coming. And here's the twist: Galactus offers to spare Earth... if they give him Reed and Sue's unborn child. Because the baby has immense power.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Whoa, whoa, whoa. So a planet-devouring cosmic entity wants to eat a baby? That's... dark. And they're going to use a baby as bait later? Are you sure about this?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It's *dramatic*. It raises the stakes! They refuse, of course. Sue gives birth in space on the way back to Earth, and the public turns on them for potentially dooming the planet. But Sue gives this rousing speech, holding the baby, and wins them back.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, a political speech from a new mother, on live TV, about saving the world? That's certainly... unexpected for a superhero movie. And then what? They fight Galactus?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, Reed's brilliant, right? So he devises a plan to teleport the entire Earth away from Galactus using these teleportation bridges.

**PRODUCER GUY:** They're going to *teleport a planet*? That's... ambitious. So they just move Earth to another galaxy?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah, but the Silver Surfer, who we learn is actually Shalla-Bal, stops them. She's been forced to be Galactus's herald to save her own world. Johnny tries to stop her, learns her language, and has this moment.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, a language barrier romance in the middle of a planetary evacuation? I guess that adds... *texture*.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly! Then, the new plan: Lure Galactus to Times Square, use Franklin—the baby—as bait, and teleport *him* away. They even negotiate with Mole Man to evacuate New York citizens to Subterranea.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Mole Man is in this? And he's just chill with evacuating New York to his underground city? This is getting pretty convoluted, but also, I kinda dig it.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It's all about family! The plan goes sideways, Galactus gets the baby, but Sue forces him into the portal using her powers. She almost dies, but then Franklin's awakened powers resuscitate her. And Shalla-Bal sacrifices herself to push Galactus in.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So the baby saves its mom, and the Silver Surfer gets a redemption arc by pushing a planet-eater into a void? And then they're heroes again. It's got heart, it's got scale, it's got a baby. This could actually work. I think this will do very well at the box office.
