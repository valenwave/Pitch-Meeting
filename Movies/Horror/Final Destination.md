**PRODUCER GUY:** So you have a new horror movie for me?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes sir, I do. So, the movie opens on a bunch of high school kids getting on a plane for a class trip to Paris.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Ah, Paris. Very romantic, very classy. I assume they’ll have a lovely time.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** They will not. See, our main character, Alex, has a super vivid and horrifying premonition that the plane is going to explode right after takeoff. We see the whole thing, it’s very scary.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, a vision! So he’s a psychic?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** We’re not going to explain it. Anyway, he completely freaks out, yelling and screaming that the plane is going to crash, which, as you can imagine, causes a bit of a ruckus.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Yeah, I feel like airlines have some pretty strict rules about yelling that kind of thing on a plane.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** They do! So he and a handful of other students, plus a teacher, all get kicked off the plane in the ensuing chaos. They’re all yelling at him in the terminal for ruining their trip, but then they look out the window and… boom! The plane explodes exactly like he saw.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wow! So they all survived because of him. They must be super grateful.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, see, here’s the hook. They were all *supposed* to die on that plane. So now, Death itself, like, the invisible force of Death, is coming to kill them one by one in the order they were meant to die.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wait, what? The bad guy is the concept of dying?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly!

**PRODUCER GUY:** How do you fight the concept of dying?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Very unsuccessfully! So first, one of the kids who got off the plane is in his bathroom, and a little puddle of water from a leaky toilet causes him to slip, which makes him fall backwards, which makes a clothesline wrap around his neck, and he strangles himself in the shower.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wow wow wow… wow. So Death’s master plan was a slippery floor? He couldn’t just have the kid have a heart attack?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, it’s gotta be a whole thing. The idea is that Death creates these super elaborate Rube Goldberg machines of doom.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Rube Goldberg machines of doom are tight!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** They sure are. So then the survivors start getting paranoid, and they learn about the "order" they were supposed to die in. They try to cheat the system, but Death is persistent.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So how does the next person go?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** The teacher! She's at home, her computer monitor sparks, which makes her spill her vodka, which then drips back into the computer, causing it to explode and send a shard of glass into her neck. She stumbles back, the trail of vodka catches fire, which makes the oven explode, which launches a chair that knocks a knife block over, and a giant kitchen knife falls and impales her.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Okay, so just to be clear, she was killed by an exploding computer, a fire, an exploding oven, *and* a falling knife?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Was Death getting paid by the hazard on that one?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Seems like it. So then there’s this one jock character, Carter, who is driving recklessly and gets his car stuck on a railroad crossing with a train coming. It’s super intense.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh man, it’s going to be tough to get out of that one.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Actually, it’s gonna be super easy, barely an inconvenience.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, really?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah, Alex manages to pull him out of the car just in the nick of time! The car gets obliterated, but he’s safe! They cheated Death!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Hooray! They figured it out!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** For about three seconds. Then the shrapnel from the car explosion hits a giant neon sign, which then swings down from its post and flattens a different student who they had just saved.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh my god. So you can’t escape. Is anyone going to survive this?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, Alex figures out that by intervening and saving someone, it skips them in the order. So he realizes his girlfriend, Clear, is next. He rushes to save her and manages to tackle her out of the way of an exploding power line, but he gets electrocuted and seemingly dies in the process.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A noble sacrifice! He beat the design!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He did! So six months later, the remaining survivors, Clear and Carter, are in Paris to honor him. They’re having a nice time, thinking it’s all over. Then a bus nearly runs them over, causing a chain reaction that makes a different giant neon sign start to fall right towards them!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Not another sign!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Alex, who actually survived being electrocuted, suddenly appears and shoves Clear out of the way, but the sign swings down and crushes Carter.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Good lord! This movie has a real problem with sign safety regulations.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It does. But then the sign swings back the other way, and it’s about to hit Alex! But it stops just short! He survived!

**PRODUCER GUY:** He did it! He’s the final boy!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** And then a bus comes out of nowhere and hits him.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A bus?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** A bus. The end.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So… everyone dies?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Pretty much! What do you think?

**PRODUCER GUY:** It’s horrifying, the logic is insane, and the deaths are so ridiculously over-the-top that teenagers are going to absolutely love it. It’ll make a decent profit.
