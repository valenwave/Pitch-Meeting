**PRODUCER GUY:** So, you have a deeply unsettling European social commentary horror film for me?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes, sir, I do! It's called *The Platform*.

**PRODUCER GUY:** The Platform! Is it about a hot new social media app where you can only post pictures of your food?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** In a way, sir. It's about a giant vertical prison with hundreds of floors. Two people per floor. And in the middle, a platform descends once a day with a gourmet feast on it.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, so it’s like a prison cruise ship! Sounds delightful.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, the people on the top floors get to eat all they want, but by the time the platform gets to the lower levels, it's just scraps, broken glass, and desperation.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, so it's like a regular cruise ship. Got it.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So our hero is a guy named Goreng, and he voluntarily enters this prison, which is called the Vertical Self-Management Center.

**PRODUCER GUY:** He volunteered for hell prison? Why?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** To get an accredited diploma.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Couldn't he just take some online classes? Seems like a much easier way to get a diploma and avoid systemic cannibalism.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He’s allowed to bring one item with him. He chose a copy of the book *Don Quixote*.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Of course he did. What an absolute protagonist. Who’s his cellmate?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** An old man named Trimagasi. He brought a self-sharpening knife.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, see, that guy's thinking practically. I feel like these two will have very different experiences.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** They will. Trimagasi explains that every month, they get gassed and moved to a random new level. One month you could be on Level 6 eating like a king, the next you're on Level 171 with nothing but your cellmate to look at.

**PRODUCER GUY:** To *look at*, right?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** For a while, yes. Trimagasi says there are three types of people: those above, those below, and those who fall.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Deep.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He also says "obvio" constantly.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Obvio. So, what happens?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, on their first month, they're on Level 48, so they get scraps. Then they get gassed and wake up on Level 171, where there's no food at all.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh no! I bet the guy with the knife has a solution for that.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He sure does. He ties Goreng up and plans to eat him, cutting off "small, clean" strips of his flesh to survive.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Whoops! The one guy with a weapon turned out to be a problem! Shocking.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** But then this feral woman named Miharu rides the platform down, kills Trimagasi, and feeds some of his flesh to Goreng so he can heal.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So he was saved from being eaten by being fed the guy who was going to eat him. The system works!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It does! So the next month Goreng is on a high level with a new cellmate, Imoguiri. She used to work for the administration and she tries to convince the people below them to ration the food.

**PRODUCER GUY:** And I'm sure the starving people below were very receptive to her polite suggestions.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** They were not. They just yelled at her. So Goreng threatens to defecate on their food unless they only take their fair share.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Ah, the poop threat. A classic negotiation tactic. So that works and everyone lives happily ever after?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, the next month they wake up on Level 202, Imoguiri hangs herself, and Goreng is forced to eat her corpse to survive. He also hallucinates conversations with his dead cellmates.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Man, this guy eats more of his roommates than a college student with a poorly stocked mini-fridge.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So next he gets a new cellmate, Baharat, on a high level. Goreng convinces him that instead of trying to escape up, they should ride the platform all the way down.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Why would they do that?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** To enforce rationing with violence and send a message back up to the chefs on Level 0.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A message? What's the message?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** An untouched, perfect panna cotta.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A panna cotta. That'll show the administration. So how are two guys supposed to stop hundreds of desperate, starving people from eating this symbolic dessert?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Actually, it's going to be super easy, barely an inconvenience.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, really?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah, they’re just going to beat the absolute tar out of anyone who even looks at the food.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Distributing food through brutal violence is tight!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So they ride down, get into a ton of bloody fights, and get really messed up. Near the bottom, on Level 333, they discover a small child hiding under a bed.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A child! In the death prison! But the administration said there were no children under 16 allowed!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** The administration may have been bending the truth. So they realize the child is the true message, not the panna cotta. They give her the dessert, and Goreng puts the child on the platform to ride back up to the top.

**PRODUCER GUY:** And then what happens? Does she make it? Does this act of defiance change the whole system?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** We don't know! Goreng gets off the platform and walks off into the darkness with the ghost of Trimagasi. It's ambiguous! It makes you *think*.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, I hate thinking! That’s the audience’s job!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So what do you think?

**PRODUCER GUY:** A bleak, violent, allegorical film about class warfare with an ambiguous ending that will leave people feeling empty and hopeless? The artsy-fartsy crowd is going to eat this up! Metaphorically, I hope.
