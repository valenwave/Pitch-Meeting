**PRODUCER GUY:** So, you got a movie for me?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes sir, I do. It’s a psychological thriller about the intense and competitive world of professional ballet.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Ballet, huh? Sounds a little… slow. Are people going to be excited to watch a bunch of dancing?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Oh, they will be, because we’re going to make ballet the most stressful and terrifying thing you’ve ever seen.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Making beautiful art forms terrifying is tight! Tell me more.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So our main character is Nina, a super dedicated ballerina who is technically perfect but also very fragile and still lives with her overbearing mother who treats her like she's twelve.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Ah, a healthy and supportive home environment.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Not at all. So, the company is putting on *Swan Lake*, and the artistic director, Thomas, needs a new Swan Queen. The role is tricky because you have to play both the innocent, pure White Swan and the dark, sensual Black Swan.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A classic duality. I like it.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Thomas thinks Nina is the perfect White Swan but doubts she has the passion to pull off the Black Swan. He's also very handsy and creepy.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A powerful man in the arts being a creep? That's a new one.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So to get the part, Nina goes to his office and he kisses her, and she bites him. Then he gives her the role.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Biting your boss leads to a promotion? I'm learning so much from this movie already.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So now the pressure is on, and Nina starts to completely lose her grip on reality. She gets these weird rashes, picks at her skin, and starts seeing things.

**PRODUCER GUY:** What kind of things?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Oh, you know, she'll see her own doppelgänger walking down the street, pictures in her mom's room will start talking to her, that kind of stuff.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So this is a horror movie now.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It’s a *psychological thriller*. The goal is for the audience to have no idea what's real and what’s a hallucination.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Utterly confusing the audience is super easy, barely an inconvenience.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Then this new dancer, Lily, shows up. She's everything Nina isn't: relaxed, confident, and super sensual. She's a natural Black Swan, and Nina becomes obsessed with her.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A rival! Let me guess, Lily is trying to sabotage her.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Maybe! Or maybe Nina is just imagining it all. It’s very ambiguous. Anyway, Lily takes Nina out for a wild night, gives her some ecstasy, and they go back to Nina's apartment.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wow wow wow… wow.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** And Nina has this intense, passionate sexual encounter with Lily. But the next morning, Lily acts like it never happened, and Nina is left even more confused. It's all about her embracing her dark side!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Right. Through a drug-fueled fever dream.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly. And as opening night gets closer, things get weirder. Nina starts hallucinating that she’s literally turning into a swan. Her legs bend backwards, and she thinks she’s growing feathers.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wait, is she a mutant now? Is this an X-Men prequel?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It's a metaphor for her transformation! So on opening night, she's a total mess. She goes back to her dressing room and sees Lily getting ready in the Black Swan costume. They get into a huge fight, and Nina stabs her with a shard from a broken mirror.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh my god! She killed her!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** She sure did. So she shoves the body in a closet and goes on stage to perform the Black Swan dance, and she absolutely crushes it. The performance is perfect. She metaphorically grows giant black wings. It's amazing.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Fantastic! So she gets away with murder and becomes a star.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, after the dance, she goes back to her dressing room, and Lily is there to congratulate her on her amazing performance.

**PRODUCER GUY:** What? But she was dead!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Nope! Turns out, there was no fight. Nina looks down and realizes the shard of glass is sticking out of her *own* stomach. She stabbed herself.

**PRODUCER GUY:** She did what now?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** But she still has to go on stage for the final act as the dying White Swan. So she goes out, bleeding profusely from a fatal stab wound, and gives the performance of her life.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Because nothing should get in the way of art, not even a life-threatening injury you inflicted upon yourself.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Precisely. The show ends, the crowd goes wild, and as she lies on the stage bleeding out, she whispers, "I was perfect." Then she dies.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So the moral of the story is that to achieve perfection, you have to go completely insane and fatally wound yourself?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** That's the one! So, what do you think?

**PRODUCER GUY:** A stressful, confusing, and terrifying ballet movie where the main character hallucinates for two hours and then stabs herself to death sounds like it might be a little hard to market. But it also sounds like something that wins a lot of awards. Let's do it.
