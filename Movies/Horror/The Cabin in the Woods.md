**PRODUCER GUY:** So you have a movie for me?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes sir, I do. It’s a horror movie about a bunch of college kids who go on a trip to a remote cabin in the woods.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A cabin in the woods? Groundbreaking. I don't think anyone's ever done that before.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, the idea here is to play with the tropes. So we have our five main characters, and they're all classic archetypes. We've got the Athlete, the Scholar, the Whore, the Fool, and the Virgin.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wow wow wow… wow. So you’re leaning *into* the cliches. That’s a bold strategy.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly! So on their way, they stop at this creepy gas station where this haggard old man warns them not to go to the cabin.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A harbinger of doom! Does he say things like, "You're goin' up there? With a car full of sin?"

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He says that verbatim, actually. Anyway, they ignore him and get to the cabin, which is super creepy, and they decide to play truth or dare. The dare is for the virgin, Dana, to go make out with a taxidermy wolf head.

**PRODUCER GUY:** That seems like a normal and not at all weird thing for friends to dare each other to do.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It is. But then the cellar door mysteriously flies open! So naturally, they all go down to investigate.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Of course they do. Exploring a dark, spooky basement in a murder cabin is always the first thing on the vacation agenda.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** And down there, they find a ton of strange objects. A music box, a conch shell, a puzzle ball…

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, a puzzle ball! Is this a Hellraiser crossover?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, sir, but that’s a great idea for the sequel. Anyway, Dana finds an old diary and reads a Latin incantation out loud from it.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Why would she do that? Is she a Latin scholar?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Nope, she just felt like it. And that summons a family of pain-worshipping zombies! But then, we cut away and reveal the whole thing is being controlled by a bunch of technicians in a massive underground facility!

**PRODUCER GUY:** What?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah, see, they’ve been pumping pheromones and mind-altering drugs into the cabin to make the kids act like horror movie characters. They even had a betting pool on what monster the kids would choose from the basement!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, so it’s not a horror movie, it's a sci-fi conspiracy movie.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It's both! So the zombies attack. The "Whore," Jules, gets her head lopped off while she's about to have sex with the Athlete, Curt.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A classic.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Then the stoner, Marty the "Fool," figures out something is wrong because the weed he's smoking is protecting him from their mind-control gas.

**PRODUCER GUY:** The weed is protecting him?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Super easy, barely an inconvenience. So the zombies attack the cabin, and Marty gets dragged off, seemingly to his death. The remaining three try to escape in their RV.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Let me guess, the RV doesn't start.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It starts! But the only tunnel out collapses, so their only hope is for Curt to try and jump a massive chasm on his dirt bike.

**PRODUCER GUY:** That seems like a very reasonable and well-thought-out plan for an athlete to have.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He almost makes it! But then he hits an invisible forcefield and splatters into the cliffside.

**PRODUCER GUY:** An invisible forcefield? So the whole area is a big dome?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It is! So Dana and the Scholar, Holden, find an elevator that takes them down into the facility. Dana gets inside but a zombie stabs Holden to death just as the doors close.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Yikes. So now she's all alone in this crazy monster facility.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Not for long! She runs into Marty, who survived! Turns out he knocked out the zombie with his giant bong and escaped.

**PRODUCER GUY:** That is a very durable bong.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It is. But then they're cornered by facility security forces. It looks like it's all over for them.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh man, it's going to be tough to escape a squad of armed guards.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Actually, it’s going to be super easy, barely an inconvenience.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, really?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah, see, Dana notices a control panel with a big red button labeled "System Purge." So she pushes it.

**PRODUCER GUY:** And what does that do?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It opens the doors to every single monster cube in the facility. And I mean *every* monster. Werewolves, ghosts, a giant snake, a Sugarplum Fairy, goblins, a killer unicorn, a merman…

**PRODUCER GUY:** A merman?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He flops up and eats one of the scientists! It's a glorious, bloody massacre as all the monsters are unleashed on the employees.

**PRODUCER GUY:** That sounds... amazing. And probably very expensive to film.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It will be worth it. So Dana and Marty make their way down to this ancient temple where they meet The Director. And she explains everything.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Okay, let's hear it.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** This whole cabin ritual is a yearly sacrifice to appease giant, evil gods called "The Ancient Ones" who live beneath the Earth. If the ritual fails and all the archetypes don't die in the right order, the gods will awaken and destroy the world.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So this is happening all over the world?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It is! But Japan failed, their ritual ended with a giant frog eating a classroom of schoolgirls. So it's all up to America. The "Fool" has to die before the "Virgin." Since Marty is alive, the ritual is broken. The Director tells Dana she has to kill Marty to complete the ritual and save humanity.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wow. So she makes the tough choice and kills her friend to save billions of lives, right?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Nope. They decide humanity isn't really worth saving, share a joint, and let the world end.

**PRODUCER GUY:** They what now? The movie ends with the literal apocalypse because the heroes just give up?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yep! We see a giant hand erupt from the ground and smash everything. Roll credits.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A horror-comedy-satire that ends with the complete and utter destruction of the human race. It's weird, it’s smart, it makes fun of the very people who will pay to see it... I think this is going to be a tough sell.
