## Rocky Horror Picture Show: The Pitch Meeting

**INT. STUDIO EXECUTIVE'S OFFICE - DAY**

PRODUCER GUY sits across from SCREENWRITER GUY, who is looking particularly dishevelled. There are crumbs on his shirt.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, what have you got for me, Screenwriter Guy? Something... normal? Something that makes sense?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Oh, definitely not normal. Not normal at all. So, imagine this: a young, wholesome, newly engaged couple, Brad and Janet, they get a flat tire on a dark and stormy night. Classic horror trope, right?

**PRODUCER GUY:** Uh-huh. I’m already getting a bad feeling about this.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** And they stumble upon this old castle, right? Like, a spooky, Gothic castle. And they go inside looking for a phone to call for help.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Sure, because that’s what you do when your car breaks down in the middle of nowhere. You go into the creepy castle filled with… what, exactly?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, this is where it gets interesting. It's filled with these bizarre, elaborately costumed people having a party. And then, the head of the house appears.

**PRODUCER GUY:** And who is the head of the house? A kindly old innkeeper? A wise sage?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He’s Dr. Frank-N-Furter! A transvestite mad scientist from the planet Transsexual in the galaxy of Transylvania!

**PRODUCER GUY:** (Blinking) Okay. Transvestite, mad scientist, alien… from *Transylvania*? Isn't Transylvania on Earth?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, it’s in space, too! It’s a whole thing. Anyway, Frank-N-Furter sings this big number about being a "sweet transvestite" and invites them to stay the night.

**PRODUCER GUY:** He *invites* them? These innocent, square people?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Oh, he does a lot more than invite them. He seduces both of them. Separately, of course. He’s very efficient.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Right. So, sex. Lots of sex. With aliens. Got it. What else happens in this… castle of questionable morality?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, Frank-N-Furter is creating a living, muscular man named Rocky. Like, he’s Frankenstein, but for… well, for *that*.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, a muscle man. Is he, like, a good guy? A hero?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Not really. He mostly just wears gold hot pants and runs around. And Janet eventually seduces him, too.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, everyone's just… getting around? Is there any plot here besides musical orgies?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes! There's Riff Raff, the creepy butler, and his sister Magenta, and they’re also aliens, and they’re planning a mutiny because Frank-N-Furter has been too indulgent. Oh, and there’s also Eddie, a biker who bursts out of a deep freeze, sings a rock song, and then Frank-N-Furter kills him with an axe and serves him for dinner!

**PRODUCER GUY:** (Eyes widening) He… he *eats* him? They eat the biker guy?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Pretty much! And then Frank-N-Furter turns everyone into nude statues and makes them perform in a cabaret show!

**PRODUCER GUY:** (Slowly shaking his head) Okay, so to recap: innocent couple, car breaks down, alien transvestite mad scientist, seduction, a created muscle man, a murderous butler, a cannibalistic dinner, and a forced cabaret. And it's a musical?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Oh yeah, lots of songs! Like "The Time Warp," where everyone just dances awkwardly. And "Sweet Transvestite." And "Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch Me." It's very catchy.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, a B-movie tribute, but with more… cross-dressing and cannibalism. And audience participation, I hear? People throwing toast? Yelling lines?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** That's the *genius* of it! We'll encourage it! It'll be an *experience*!

**PRODUCER GUY:** An experience, indeed. This sounds… bonkers. Absolutely, utterly bonkers. But you know what? Sometimes bonkers works. Sometimes, people want to be weird and embrace the madness. I think this could actually do... something.

**CUT TO BLACK.**
