**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So, I’ve got a zombie movie for you.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A zombie movie? Groundbreaking.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** But this one is a comedy!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, a zombie comedy, you say? Well, that’s never been done before.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So, the movie starts, and the world has already been overrun by zombies. We're following this nerdy college kid who has survived by creating a list of rules.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Rules? For a zombie apocalypse? Is one of them ‘don’t get bitten’? Because that seems like a pretty important one.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** That's implied. His rules are more specific, like "Cardio," "Double Tap," and "Beware of Bathrooms." And we’re going to have these rules pop up on screen in big, bold letters whenever they’re relevant.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, the audience will be learning how to survive a zombie apocalypse while watching a movie? That’s educational!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly! So, this kid, who goes by Columbus, meets this other survivor, Tallahassee. Tallahassee is a tough, zombie-killing machine who is on a desperate quest.

**PRODUCER GUY:** To save humanity? To find a cure?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** To find a Twinkie.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A Twinkie. The fate of mankind rests on a golden, cream-filled sponge cake. I love it.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So, Columbus and Tallahassee team up, and then they run into two sisters, Wichita and Little Rock. They're con artists.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Of course, they are. Because in a world full of flesh-eating monsters, what you really need to worry about is a couple of grifters.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** They trick our heroes and steal their car and weapons. Twice.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, our main characters are not very good at this whole survival thing, are they?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, they eventually form an uneasy alliance and decide to travel together. The sisters want to go to an amusement park in California called Pacific Playland, which they believe is a zombie-free zone.

**PRODUCER GUY:** An amusement park? Zombies have overrun the entire country, and they think an amusement park is the one place that’s safe? Did they see a commercial for it or something?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It’s a place from their childhood. It’s symbolic. Anyway, on their way, they stop at a mansion in Hollywood.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Let me guess, it belongs to a celebrity who is also a zombie.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Close! It’s Bill Murray’s house, and he’s not a zombie. He just pretends to be one to get around.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Bill Murray is in this movie? Playing himself? That’s amazing!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah! So, they’re all hanging out with Bill Murray, and they decide to play a prank on Columbus. Bill Murray pretends to be a zombie to scare him.

**PRODUCER GUY:** And Columbus freaks out, right?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He shoots and kills him.

**PRODUCER GUY:** He… he kills Bill Murray? The real Bill Murray?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, the character of Bill Murray. It’s a shocking but hilarious moment!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Killing a beloved national treasure is tight!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So, after that, Wichita and Little Rock leave for Pacific Playland. Columbus, who has a crush on Wichita, convinces Tallahassee to go after them.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Because nothing says "I love you" like following someone to a potentially zombie-infested theme park.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** When they get there, the sisters have turned on all the lights and rides, which, of course, attracts a massive horde of zombies.

**PRODUCER GUY:** It’s almost like that was a terrible idea.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** They get trapped on a drop tower ride, and it’s up to Columbus and Tallahassee to save them. There's a big, climactic battle in the amusement park.

**PRODUCER GUY:** An amusement park is a pretty fun place for a zombie showdown. I can already see the marketing.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** In the end, they all survive and become a kind of dysfunctional family.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A zombie-killing, con-artist-filled family. It’s heartwarming. So, what do you think?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It’s got action, it’s got comedy, it’s got heart, and it’s got a cameo that people will be talking about for years. What’s not to love?

**PRODUCER GUY:** I like it. A zombie comedy with a bunch of rules and a quest for a Twinkie. It’s so dumb it might actually work. I think this could be a sleeper hit.
