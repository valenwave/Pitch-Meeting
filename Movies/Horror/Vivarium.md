## Pitch Meeting: Vivarium

**INT. STUDIO EXECUTIVE'S OFFICE - DAY**

PRODUCER GUY sips from a very large, very expensive coffee mug. SCREENWRITER GUY sits across from him, looking a little too enthusiastic.

**PRODUCER GUY**
Alright, so what's the big idea? Hit me with it.

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
Okay, so it's a sci-fi thriller, right? About a young couple, very much in love, looking to buy their first home. They go to this *really* weird real estate agency...

**PRODUCER GUY**
Weird, how weird? Like, "takes his shoes off and puts his feet on the desk" weird, or "has a pet ferret named Bartholomew" weird?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
More like... unsettlingly precise. And he speaks in a very unnatural, almost robotic way. They get lured to this new housing development called Yonder. Every house is identical, bright green roofs, perfect lawns.

**PRODUCER GUY**
So, it's like a commentary on suburban conformity? Like *The Stepford Wives* meets... like, a really clean cul-de-sac?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
Exactly! But then, the real estate agent just drives off and leaves them there. And they try to leave, but no matter what road they take, they always end up back at house number nine.

**PRODUCER GUY**
So, it's a maze? A really boring maze? Are there, like, hedge walls that pop up and say "Surprise!"?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
No, no, it's more existential. They run out of gas, they try to walk out, but they just keep coming back. It's like the neighborhood itself is a trap. And then, a box appears on their doorstep.

**PRODUCER GUY**
Ooh, a mystery box! Is it, like, artisanal cheeses? Or maybe a gift basket with, like, a bunch of those tiny shampoo bottles?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
No, it's a baby. With instructions: "Raise the child and be released."

**PRODUCER GUY**
...A baby. From a box. In a suburban nightmare prison. Okay. So, they have a baby, and it's like, super cute, right? They fall in love with it?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
Not exactly. This kid... it grows unnervingly fast. Like, in days. And it mimics everything they say, but with this disturbing, detached voice. And it screams. A lot.

**PRODUCER GUY**
So, it's like every parent's worst nightmare, but with a sci-fi twist. Got it. Is the kid, like, an alien? Is that the big reveal?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
Well, it's heavily implied to be a form of brood parasite, like a cuckoo bird. The movie actually opens with a scene of a cuckoo chick pushing other eggs out of a nest.

**PRODUCER GUY**
A cuckoo bird. So, they're raising a monstrous cuckoo alien in a suburban prison, and the big message is... parenthood is hard? Homeownership is a trap?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
All of the above! And the husband, Tom, he gets obsessed with digging a giant hole in the front yard, thinking it's their way out.

**PRODUCER GUY**
A hole. He's digging a hole. In the perfectly manicured lawn of the suburban prison. Is it a metaphor for... digging your own grave? Because that sounds a little on the nose.

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
...It could be interpreted that way. And the wife, Gemma, she's trying to cope with this rapidly aging, creepy kid. They're slowly losing their minds.

**PRODUCER GUY**
So, it's depressing? Is there, like, a happy ending where they escape and realize the joys of renting?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
Not really. Tom eventually dies from exhaustion, literally in the hole he's been digging. And the grown-up "child" puts him in a body bag and throws him in there.

**PRODUCER GUY**
Oh, so it's a horror movie now? Or just, like, an art house bummer?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
And then Gemma tries to escape, and she finds these other identical houses with other trapped couples! It's a whole system! But she falls back into her own house, and the grown-up "child" does the same thing to her. Zips her into a body bag, throws her in the hole.

**PRODUCER GUY**
Wow. That's... relentlessly bleak. And then the alien child takes over the real estate agency and continues the cycle, right?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
You got it! It's a powerful statement about the inescapable cycle of consumerism and societal expectations!

**PRODUCER GUY**
Okay, so it's a bit of a downer, very artsy, with some existential dread mixed with alien cuckoo birds. Jesse Eisenberg and Imogen Poots are in it, though, so that's something. I think this could be a real hit with people who enjoy feeling uncomfortable and pondering the meaninglessness of existence.
