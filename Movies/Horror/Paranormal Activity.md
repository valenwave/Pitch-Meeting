**PRODUCER GUY:** So you have a movie for me?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes sir, I do. It’s a horror movie.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, fantastic. Is it about a creepy doll or a guy in a weird mask?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, sir. This is going to be way more grounded. We’re going to call it *Paranormal Activity*.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Ooh, that sounds spooky and also like a thing I could watch on basic cable.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly! So there’s this young couple, Katie and Micah, and they’ve just moved into a new house.

**PRODUCER GUY:** And I bet some weird stuff starts happening, right?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** You know it. Katie tells Micah that a spooky presence has been following her since she was a little kid.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A lifelong spooky friend! That's kind of sweet.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Not so much. So Micah, being a modern man of technology, decides to set up a camera in their bedroom to record whatever happens while they sleep.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Ah, the found footage technique. So it’ll look like a home movie?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yep! It’s going to be super cheap to make!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, making things for very little money is tight!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So at first, it’s just little things. Flickering lights, doors moving on their own, some strange noises.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Classic ghost shenanigans.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** But then it starts to get more intense. One night, Katie just gets out of bed and stands there, staring at Micah for two hours straight.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Just staring? That’s not terrifying at all. My wife does that to me all the time.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Micah decides to get a Ouija board to try and communicate with the entity.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, because that always goes so well in these movies.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It does not. The Ouija board spells out a spooky message and then catches on fire.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Spontaneous combustion is a real problem with those things.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Then things really escalate. An unseen force grabs Katie and drags her out of the bedroom.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Whoa! So they’re in some real danger now.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** For sure. Micah finds a weird bite mark on her back the next morning. He wants to leave the house, but Katie, who is clearly not herself, insists they stay.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So she’s possessed now?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It would certainly seem so, sir. So on the final night, Katie gets up again, goes downstairs, and starts screaming for Micah.

**PRODUCER GUY:** And he goes running down to save her, I assume.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He sure does. We hear a big struggle, and then silence. Then Micah’s body gets chucked at the camera, knocking it over.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh my god! So he’s dead?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Super dead. Then Katie walks into the frame, all bloody, and lunges at the camera. And that’s the end.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wow. Just… wow. A low-budget horror movie that relies on suspense and what you *don’t* see? I think people are going to go nuts for this.
