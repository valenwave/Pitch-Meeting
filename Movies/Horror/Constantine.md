(Lights up on a standard, slightly disheveled producer's office. PRODUCER GUY sits behind a desk, looking vaguely annoyed. SCREENWRITER GUY sits opposite him, nervously clutching a stack of papers.)

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, what's this next one, then? Another gritty superhero reboot? Because I swear to God, if I have to hear about one more dark and edgy origin story—

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, no, not at all! This is… different. It's an adaptation. From a comic book, actually, but it's very much its own thing.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, a comic book. So, the source material is, what, Spider-Man? Batman? Something people have actually heard of?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, it's… *Hellblazer*.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Hell-what-now? Is that like a new kind of breakfast cereal? With little devil horns? Sounds delicious.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, it's a Vertigo comic, very adult. And the main character is John Constantine, a cynical, chain-smoking exorcist who battles demons and angels.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Okay, okay, so he's an exorcist. Like *The Exorcist*? Are we talking pea soup and head-spinning? Because that's been done.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, not exactly. He's kind of a supernatural detective. He sends demons back to hell, but he's also dying of lung cancer.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Dying of lung cancer? So, it's a medical drama with demons? Is he gonna get a lung transplant from a demon? Because that's… that's an idea. Write that down.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Uh, no, it's more about him trying to earn his way into Heaven, because he was born with the ability to see half-demons and half-angels, and he sent himself to hell once, and he's been kind of a jerk his whole life.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So he's a jerk, he smokes, and he sees demons. And he's dying. This sounds like a real feel-good movie. Are we going for the "audience leaves feeling utterly depressed" award?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, there's action! He has this holy shotgun, and he uses holy water and stuff! And there's this woman, Angela, who he helps, whose sister seemingly committed suicide but was actually dragged to hell.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, a detective story, but with a spiritual twist. And a holy shotgun. Does he reload it with holy bullets? Because I’m picturing a whole assembly line of priests making bullets. That’s a visual.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** And there’s Gabriel, an angel, who’s kind of a jerk, and wants to bring about the apocalypse.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So the *angels* are bad now? Is nothing sacred anymore? Next you'll tell me Santa Claus is a demon. Actually, hold on, write that down. Evil Santa. We could put him in a horror movie.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** And the Devil shows up at the end! He’s wearing a pristine white suit!

**PRODUCER GUY:** The Devil in a white suit. So he’s a fashionista now? Does he offer Constantine a nice cappuccino before he drags him away? This is getting a little… stylish.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** And Constantine tricks him into healing his cancer by essentially sacrificing himself to save Angela, and then the Devil gets mad because he can't have Constantine's soul if he's not dying anymore.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So he tricks the Devil. With lung cancer. That’s… that's quite a twist. So, what, the Devil just throws a tantrum and leaves? Does he stomp his foot and say, "Fine, you win *this time*, Constantine!"?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, he does get a little upset. But then he cures Constantine's cancer because if he goes to heaven, the Devil doesn't get his soul. It's a whole thing. And then Constantine finally gives up smoking.

**PRODUCER GUY:** He gives up smoking? After all that? So the moral of the story is, if you trick the Devil into curing your cancer, you might as well quit the bad habits? Fascinating. So, we've got a cynical, chain-smoking, demon-fighting, cancer-ridden detective who tricks the Devil and then quits smoking. This is a very specific niche audience, I think.

(Producer Guy leans back in his chair, a thoughtful, if still slightly mocking, look on his face.)

**PRODUCER GUY:** You know what? It's got some flair. The whole "Catholic noir" thing, the demons, the angels… people love that dark, edgy stuff, especially if it's based on something obscure enough that they can pretend they discovered it. Yeah, I think this could actually do pretty well.

(Cuts to a news headline, glowing on a screen.)
