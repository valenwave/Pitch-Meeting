## Scene: Pitch Meeting

**INT. PRODUCER'S OFFICE - DAY**

PRODUCER GUY is sitting at his desk, looking very busy and important. SCREENWRITER GUY bursts in, carrying a stack of papers.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So, I have this idea for a new horror movie! It's gonna be super intense, very British.

**PRODUCER GUY:** British, huh? So, lots of tea and polite screaming?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Even better! It starts with these animal rights activists breaking into a lab, right? And they accidentally unleash this super-fast, super-aggro virus called "Rage."

**PRODUCER GUY:** Rage virus? So, it makes people... angry? Like, "I can't believe they cancelled Firefly" angry?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** More like "I will rip your face off and eat your spleen" angry. And they're not zombies, okay? They're *infected*. Very important distinction.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, *infected*. So they're just... people with a really bad case of the flu who also want to tear you limb from limb? Got it. So, what happens after the rage gets out? Does everyone just go about their day, slightly peeved?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, no, no! Twenty-eight days later, our main character, Jim, wakes up from a coma in an abandoned hospital. London is completely deserted. Empty. Silent.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, like a normal Monday morning commute, but without the Tube delays?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly! But then he runs into these *infected* people, and he has to team up with other survivors, like Selena and Frank.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Selena, the woman who's, like, constantly carrying a machete and ready to kill anyone at the drop of a hat?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** She's resourceful! And then they try to find a military safe zone, which, naturally, turns out to be run by a bunch of absolutely terrible soldiers led by a very dodgy major.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, the *infected* aren't the only monsters, it's also, you know, regular humans being terrible. Very profound. Is there, like, a scene where the little girl, Hannah, sees a plane in the sky and it gives them hope?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** There is! It's a key moment! And then Jim goes full Rambo and unleashes an infected guy on the soldiers. It's awesome.

**PRODUCER GUY:** And then at the end, they're just, like, chilling in a cottage and the *infected* are starving to death? So they just... win? Because the *infected* didn't think to grab a snack?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, it's about the passage of time! And hope! And... humanity! It's very deep.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Okay, okay, I'm sensing a theme here. Fast *infected*, grim Britain, questionable human morality. You know what? I think this could actually do really well. It's got that indie grit, but with enough horror to pull in a crowd. I think we could be looking at something big.
