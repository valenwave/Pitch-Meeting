**Setting:** A bland, brightly lit office. PRODUCER GUY sits across from SCREENWRITER GUY, who is nervously clutching a stack of papers.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Alright, so you've got another one for me. What's the pitch? Don't tell me it's another gritty, handheld camera zombie movie. We just did that!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, yes, but this is a *sequel*! To *28 Days Later*! We're calling it *28 Weeks Later*! See, it's been more time.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, wow, original. So, what's happening? Are the zombies still fast? Because that was a whole thing.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Oh, absolutely! Still super fast, super angry. But here's the twist: Great Britain has been "reclaimed"! NATO forces have moved in, they're setting up safe zones, repatriating survivors. It's all very hopeful!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Hopeful, eh? I don't like hopeful. Hopeful doesn't sell tickets. Where's the misery? Where's the gratuitous violence?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Don't worry, we get there! So, we follow this family, a father who survived the initial outbreak, and his two kids who were out of the country. They're reunited in a safe zone on the Isle of Dogs. It's supposed to be impenetrable!

**PRODUCER GUY:** "Supposed to be." I like where this is going.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly! So, the kids, being kids, sneak out to go back to their old house to get some mementos, and what do they find? Their mother! Alive!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wait, so the mom survived the original outbreak, and the dad just... left her? And never mentioned it? That's a bit of a plot hole, isn't it?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It's... character motivation! He felt guilty! Anyway, she's an asymptomatic carrier of the Rage virus. Totally fine herself, but if she bites someone, they go full rage-mode.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Of course she is. And who's the first one she infects, because obviously, someone's getting infected, right?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, the father! He goes to visit her, begs for forgiveness, they share a kiss... and *boom!* Rage virus!

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, a whole safe zone, military presence, and they just let an infected person have visitors? And the father is just like, "Hey, let me get a little smooch on." You know, for a guy who abandoned his wife, he's surprisingly affectionate now.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It's the guilt, Producer Guy! He's just so full of guilt! And then he goes on a rampage, and the whole thing just spirals! The military tries to contain it, but they can't, so they start indiscriminately shooting everyone! Infected or not!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Now *that's* what I like to hear! Indiscriminate shooting! And then what? More explosions? Because the first one had a good amount of explosions.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Oh, we got explosions! They firebomb the whole zone! But some people escape, including the kids, and a soldier, and a medical officer. And the infected father is still out there, chasing them! He's like a Terminator, but with rage!

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, London gets re-destroyed. Excellent. And then the virus spreads to... where else? Because we can't just have it contained, that's not franchise potential.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, the very end, we see the virus has made it to Paris! Just a little hint of what's to come!

**PRODUCER GUY:** *Chef's kiss* Beautiful. A tragic, cyclical nightmare. That's money right there. I think this one's got legs. Or, you know, really fast running infected. Whatever.

**PRODUCER GUY:** This movie is going to be a moderate success. It's got the name recognition, the action, and enough bleakness to satisfy the fans.
