**(SCENE START)**

**INT. PRODUCER'S OFFICE - DAY**

The PRODUCER GUY looks skeptically at the SCREENWRITER GUY, who is holding a very thick binder.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, you're telling me after all these years, the rage virus is back? And we're calling it *28 Years Later*? Isn't that just... 28 *Days* Later, but older? That's super easy, barely an inconvenience.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, sir, it's not just "older"! It's about a **new generation** growing up in this post-apocalyptic world! The UK has been quarantined, cut off from the rest of the world. It's almost like a commentary on... **Brexit**!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Right. Because when I think "zombie horror," I think "political allegory." Super subtle. So, the Rage Virus didn't spread globally? That's a bit of a retcon from *28 Weeks Later*, isn't it? I thought Paris got nuked?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** (Wipes brow) Minor adjustments for narrative flow, sir! We're focusing on the UK, and how different communities have adapted. We've got a new main character, Spike, a 12-year-old boy from a secluded island community on **Holy Island**.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Holy Island? So, like, a safe haven? Full of quaint, traditional folk who are also, naturally, expert zombie killers?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly! But Spike, along with his parents, has to venture onto the mainland, which is still overrun. And they encounter **evolved infected**! We're talking **Alphas** now â€“ stronger, more intelligent!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, so not just the fast-running ones. Now they're doing, what, complex calculus? Are they building little demon forts?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** More like, they're physically imposing, and they hunt in packs! And there's also **Dr. Kelson**, played by Ralph Fiennes, a mysterious survivor who's developed... a unique way of dealing with the infected.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Ralph Fiennes is in this? So, he's either going to be a terrifying villain or a surprisingly helpful, quirky scientist. Or both! And what's this "unique way"? Does he, like, try to teach them interpretive dance?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He's created a sort of **bone temple**, sir. It's very... ritualistic. And he believes in accepting death as part of life.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Right, because that's what you want when you're surrounded by rage-filled monsters: a philosophical debate about mortality. Super practical. And what about the family drama? Because every good horror movie needs some family drama.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Spike's mother, Isla, is gravely ill with a mysterious sickness, not the Rage Virus. Spike believes Kelson can cure her. And his father, Jamie, is... well, he's got his own issues. There's some marital infidelity that really sends Spike on his own journey.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, the kid is trying to save his mom from an un-zombie illness, while his dad is, like, being a bad husband, and meanwhile, super-zombies are everywhere. This is a very specific set of problems. And the ending? Does the UK finally get saved? Do they find a cure?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, Spike goes on a solo journey after some truly traumatic events. And he's eventually rescued by a new faction of survivors led by an adult **Jimmy**! The original kid from the opening of *28 Days Later*!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wait, *that* Jimmy? The kid from the church? So he's all grown up and leading a **cult** now? With, like, **tracksuits** and parkour moves?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It's a very striking visual, sir! They're like a strange, new adaptation to this brutal world. And it leaves the future completely open for the next two films in the new trilogy!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Next *two* films? So, this is just the beginning of more Rage, more Britain, and more baffling cults? You're setting up a whole new world of inconvenience, aren't you?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It's a fresh take, sir! It explores the psychological and societal consequences of living in this kind of world for decades! It's a **cerebral horror**!

**PRODUCER GUY:** "Cerebral horror" that still involves people getting torn apart by incredibly fast, angry people. Got it. Just make sure those Alphas look really, really scary. And that Jimmy cult needs some catchy chants. We need a new "In the House, In a Heartbeat" moment.
