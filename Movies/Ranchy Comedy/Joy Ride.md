**PRODUCER GUY:** So, you have a new raunchy comedy for me?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes sir, I do! It’s called Joy Ride!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, that sounds like a movie about a pleasant car journey.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, it’s not really that. So, our main character is Audrey. She’s an ambitious lawyer who was adopted from China as a baby by white parents, so she doesn't really feel connected to her Asian heritage.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Okay, a classic fish-out-of-water-in-their-own-water story.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly! So her firm is sending her to China to close a huge deal, and she needs a translator, so she brings her childhood best friend Lolo.

**PRODUCER GUY:** And what's her deal?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** She’s a chaotic artist who makes sexually explicit sculptures and is the exact opposite of Audrey.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Ah, the wild best friend who helps the uptight character loosen up. A tale as old as time.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It sure is! And Lolo brings along her cousin, Deadeye, who is socially awkward and completely obsessed with K-pop. And then they meet up with Audrey’s college roommate, Kat, who is now a famous soap opera star in China and is engaged to her very Christian co-star.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So we’ve got the uptight one, the wild one, the weird one, and the famous one. Sounds like a well-balanced party.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It is! But here’s the twist: the Chinese businessman she’s trying to make a deal with says he won’t sign unless he meets her family. He thinks it's weird she doesn't know them.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So a business trip is about to turn into a deeply personal and emotional journey to find her birth mother?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** You know it! So they get on a train to go find the adoption agency, and they end up sharing a car with a very friendly American woman.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, that’s nice.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Who turns out to be a drug dealer.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, even nicer! Drug dealing is tight!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah, but then the authorities come on board to search the train, so they have to hide an entire bag of cocaine!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh no! It's going to be difficult to hide a bunch of drugs from the police.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Actually, it's going to be super easy, barely an inconvenience.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, really?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah, they just hide all the little baggies of cocaine in their various orifices.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh my god.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So they get kicked off the train anyway, and all their luggage and passports get stolen. But luckily, they run into an American basketball team who offers them a ride on their private bus.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A bus full of professional athletes. I’m sure that will lead to a very wholesome and quiet evening.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It leads to a massive party where everyone does drugs and hooks up! But then a video of their wild night goes viral, which is very bad for Kat’s wholesome public image.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh boy, a viral sex-and-drugs video. That’s not great for business.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It is not. So the friends all have a massive fight. Audrey fires Lolo, Kat’s fiancé finds out she lied about her sexual history and leaves her, and everyone is sad.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wow. Friendship in shambles.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It is. But Audrey decides to continue the journey alone and finds the woman she thinks is her birth mother. But it’s the wrong person.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Whoopsie!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** But that family is super nice and helps her connect with her actual birth mother via video call. And her mom explains through tears that she had to give Audrey up because her husband was badly injured right after she was born and they couldn't support a child. It’s a very emotional moment.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Aww, that's actually really sweet and heartbreaking.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It is! So Audrey realizes that her friends are her real family, so she races to the airport to catch them before they fly home.

**PRODUCER GUY:** The classic airport reconciliation scene! A pillar of the rom-com and friend-com genre.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Of course! They all make up, Audrey quits her job at the stuffy law firm, and the movie ends with them all on vacation together in Paris.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A raunchy comedy with a surprising amount of heart. It sounds like it’s got all the right ingredients. I think people are going to really connect with this.
