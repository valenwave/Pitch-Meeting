**PRODUCER GUY:** So you have a new teen comedy for me?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes sir, I do. It's about four high school friends who make a pact to lose their virginity by prom night.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Groundbreaking. So it's a documentary?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Not quite, sir. So our main guy is Jim. He's a bit awkward, and his dad keeps walking in on him at the most inopportune times.

**PRODUCER GUY:** "Inopportune times" are tight!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So, Jim's friend Oz tells him that third base feels like a warm apple pie.

**PRODUCER GUY:** I have a feeling I know where this is going, and I don't like it. Or maybe I do.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So Jim goes home, gets an apple pie from the kitchen, and, well...

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh no.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** And of course, his dad walks in right at that moment.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Of course he does! This dad has the worst/best timing in cinematic history.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** And his dad, trying to be cool, just says, "We'll just tell your mother we ate it."

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wow. Father of the year right there. So what other shenanigans do these boys get into?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, Jim tries to hook up with a foreign exchange student named Nadia. He sets up a webcam so his friends can watch.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Because that's what good friends do.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** But he accidentally broadcasts it to the entire school.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Whoops!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah, and he finishes a little too early. Twice.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A classic tale of premature success. So who does he end up with?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He ends up asking the band geek, Michelle, to prom. She seems sweet and innocent.

**PRODUCER GUY:** I sense a twist coming.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** You bet! Turns out she's not so innocent and has a lot of stories that start with, "This one time, at band camp..."

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh my god.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Then there's Finch, who's more sophisticated. He tries to build up a reputation.

**PRODUCER GUY:** How does he do that?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** By spreading rumors about himself. But then the school jock, Stifler, spikes his coffee with a laxative before the prom.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, a classic prank! Humiliation is a key ingredient in teen comedies.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** But Finch gets the last laugh! At Stifler's after-prom party, he hooks up with Stifler's mom.

**PRODUCER GUY:** The ultimate revenge! Stifler's Mom must be a cinematic icon.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** She will be. So what do you think?

**PRODUCER GUY:** It's raunchy, it's awkward, and it has a weird amount of heart. It's going to be huge with teenagers. They'll love it.
