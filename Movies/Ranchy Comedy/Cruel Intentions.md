**PRODUCER GUY:** So you have a movie for me?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes sir, I do. It’s a modern adaptation of an 18th-century French novel about rich, bored aristocrats.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, so it’s going to be super relatable for today’s audiences.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly! We’re just going to set it in 90s New York with rich, bored teenagers instead.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Rich teenagers being terrible to each other is tight!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It is! So we have these two step-siblings, Kathryn and Sebastian. They are super wealthy, super popular, and super manipulative.

**PRODUCER GUY:** And they’re living in a giant Manhattan mansion with no parental supervision whatsoever.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Seemingly not! So, Kathryn gets dumped by this guy for a naive girl named Cecile. To get revenge, she wants Sebastian to seduce and corrupt Cecile to ruin her reputation.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A classic tale of teenage revenge.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** But Sebastian thinks that's too easy. He has his sights set on a different challenge: Annette Hargrove, the new headmaster’s daughter. She just wrote an article for a teen magazine about how she's saving herself for marriage.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, so she's the ultimate prize for a guy like him.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** You know it. So Kathryn and Sebastian make a wager. If Sebastian can seduce Annette, Kathryn will sleep with him.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wait, his stepsister?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** That's the one.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Stepsibling romance is tight! So what if he loses?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Then Kathryn gets his priceless 1956 Jaguar XK140 roadster.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So the stakes are either incest or a vintage car. This is the most 90s rich-kid thing I've ever heard.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It really is. So, Sebastian starts trying to charm Annette. He shows up at her grandfather's house, pretends to be into charity, the whole nine yards. But she's not falling for it.

**PRODUCER GUY:** She’s too smart for his games.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly. Meanwhile, as a side project, Sebastian decides to help Kathryn with her Cecile problem. He finds out Cecile is in love with her music teacher, Ronald. So Sebastian manipulates Cecile, gets blackmail photos of her with Ronald, and then sleeps with her himself.

**PRODUCER GUY:** This guy is just a whirlwind of terrible decisions.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He’s the best at being the worst! So after a while, Sebastian’s constant pursuit starts to wear Annette down. He tells her he’s a changed man, and they go on a cute date where they volunteer at a nursing home.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, let me guess, the bad boy player is actually starting to fall for the one good girl who can change him?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It’s like you’ve seen a movie before, sir! He totally falls for her. They even have a very romantic moment on an escalator.

**PRODUCER GUY:** An escalator? The peak of romance.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It is! And he ends up sleeping with her. So he won the bet!

**PRODUCER GUY:** So now he gets to sleep with his stepsister! Hooray?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, no. He goes back to Kathryn and tells her he failed because he’s in love with Annette and doesn’t want to treat her like a conquest.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Aw, he grew a conscience. How does Kathryn take that?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** She gets furious. She tells him that if he won't sleep with her, then he can't have Annette either. She calls Annette and tells her that Sebastian was just using her for a bet.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Ouch. That’s gotta hurt.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It does. And Kathryn also calls Ronald's boss and ruins his life, and then tells Cecile’s mom that Sebastian deflowered her. It’s a whole mess.

**PRODUCER GUY:** She’s really committed to the chaos.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** She is. So Sebastian, realizing he’s lost everything, decides to do one good thing. He gives Annette his personal journal, which contains all of his and Kathryn’s schemes, manipulations, and secrets. He wants Annette to expose Kathryn.

**PRODUCER GUY:** The pen is mightier than the sword, especially when it’s filled with scandalous teenage drama.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** For sure. But then Ronald finds out from Cecile that Sebastian was the one who slept with her, so he goes to confront him in the street right as Sebastian is talking to Annette. They get into a fight, Sebastian pushes Ronald out of the way of an oncoming taxi and gets hit himself.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wow, so he dies a hero? That seems a bit sudden.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He sure does. Dies right there in Annette’s arms.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Man, Kathryn really messed things up. It’s going to be tough for anyone to prove she was behind all this.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Actually, it’s going to be super easy, barely an inconvenience.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, really?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah, see, Annette takes Sebastian's journal and prints out copies for the entire school. At Sebastian’s funeral, while Kathryn is giving a eulogy, everyone starts reading it. They find out she’s a manipulative liar and also that the crucifix she wears around her neck is secretly a cocaine stash.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A cocaine crucifix! Wow wow wow wow!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So she’s publicly humiliated and runs out crying. The final shot is Annette driving away in Sebastian’s Jaguar, wearing his sunglasses and smiling.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So she got the guy’s car and his journal. A pretty good haul, all things considered.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It is! So what do you think?

**PRODUCER GUY:** A movie about rich, attractive young people being cruel to each other, set to a killer 90s soundtrack? I think this is going to be a cult classic for decades.
