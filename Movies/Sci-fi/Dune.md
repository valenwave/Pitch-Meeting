**Setting:** A dimly lit, stark white office. Producer Guy sits across from Screenwriter Guy, who is holding a very thick manuscript.

**Producer Guy:** So, what've you got for me today, Screenwriter Guy? Something with a little less… *sand*, this time?

**Screenwriter Guy:** Well, actually, it's called *Dune*.

**Producer Guy:** *Dune*? As in, sand dunes? From that incredibly dense, unfilmable book?

**Screenwriter Guy:** The very same! But this time, we're going to lean into the epic scope, the grand visuals, the… *vibe*.

**Producer Guy:** "Vibe"? That's your pitch? So, less story, more… atmospheric stares into the middle distance?

**Screenwriter Guy:** Precisely! We're talking sweeping desert vistas, massive sandworms, and Timothée Chalamet looking very concerned.

**Producer Guy:** Ah, Timothée. Good. So, he's the hero, right? Paul Atreides, a brilliant young man, destined for greatness.

**Screenwriter Guy:** Oh, he's definitely *destined* for greatness. And he has a lot of visions. Like, *a lot* of visions. He'll be seeing Zendaya in the desert constantly.

**Producer Guy:** Zendaya? What's her role? Is she, like, the kick-butt sidekick? The love interest?

**Screenwriter Guy:** She's… the girl from his visions. She mostly says "This is just the beginning."

**Producer Guy:** "This is just the beginning." So, she's basically a walking trailer for the next movie?

**Screenwriter Guy:** Think of it as a narrative promise! Anyway, Paul's family, House Atreides, moves to Arrakis, which is this desert planet, but it's super important because it has this "spice."

**Producer Guy:** Spice. Is it like… actual spice? For cooking?

**Screenwriter Guy:** No, no, it's a valuable psychotropic substance that allows for interstellar travel and gives people heightened awareness. And it's only found on Arrakis.

**Producer Guy:** So, it's basically space oil. Got it. And the previous guys, the Harkonnens, they're not happy about the Atreides taking over, right?

**Screenwriter Guy:** Not at all! They're super evil. Like, cartoonishly evil. The Baron Harkonnen floats around and is incredibly grotesque.

**Producer Guy:** Floating evil guy. Okay. So, they betray the Atreides, and Paul and his mom, Lady Jessica, are stranded in the desert?

**Screenwriter Guy:** That's the plan! And they encounter the Fremen, the native people of Arrakis, who are super resilient because they live in a desert and have developed really cool ways to survive.

**Producer Guy:** Like what? Do they have, like, special desert survival training montages?

**Screenwriter Guy:** They wear "stillsuits" that recycle their bodily moisture. And they can walk without attracting sandworms. Until Paul walks around like a total noob and almost gets eaten.

**Producer Guy:** So, our destined hero needs to be saved by the locals, after ignoring their customs? That's… bold. And then he joins them, right? And becomes their leader?

**Screenwriter Guy:** He eventually fights one of them, Jamis, in a ritual duel to the death and wins! And then says, "My road leads to the desert." Very dramatic.

**Producer Guy:** "My road leads to the desert." So, this whole movie is essentially setup for the *next* movie, where he actually *does* stuff?

**Screenwriter Guy:** Exactly! We leave the audience wanting more. It's an immersive experience. Visually stunning. The sound design alone will win awards!

**Producer Guy:** So, what you're telling me is we're spending a hundred and sixty-five million dollars on half a story, with a lot of sand, a lot of intense staring, and a floating villain, all culminating in a guy saying his road leads to the desert?

**Screenwriter Guy:** It's an *epic* half-story! And it's going to be gorgeous. People will be talking about the scale of it! The world-building!

**Producer Guy:** You know what, Screenwriter Guy? I like your confidence. And let's be honest, people are desperate for a big, serious sci-fi movie that's not, you know, just superheroes or robots. This "vibe" thing might actually work. I think this *Dune* has a good chance of exceeding expectations.
