Screenwriter Guy: So, I have this idea for a movie.

Producer Guy: Oh really? Another one? Is it about a talking dog who solves mysteries? Because I’ve got like three of those in development already.

Screenwriter Guy: No, no, it’s a sci-fi movie. About aliens.

Producer Guy: Aliens, you say? Are they gonna blow stuff up? Because explosions are good. People like explosions.

Screenwriter Guy: Well, eventually, there’s some… tension. But it’s more about communication. And language.

Producer Guy: Language? So, like, the aliens come down and they’re like, “Take me to your leader,” and then we gotta teach them English? Sounds riveting.

Screenwriter Guy: Not exactly. They arrive in these… giant, smooth, black, oblong ships. And they just kind of… hover. All over the world.

Producer Guy: So, no grand entrance? No big flashy lights and stuff? Just… hovering? That doesn’t sound very dramatic.

Screenwriter Guy: Well, then we bring in a linguist. To try and understand their language. And it’s not linear. It’s… a circle.

Producer Guy: A circle? Like, they just draw a circle and that means, “Hello”? Are we sure these aliens are, like, super intelligent? Or did they just forget how to write?

Screenwriter Guy: No, it’s complex! And it changes how she perceives time. She starts to experience the future.

Producer Guy: Wait, so she’s learning the language, and then suddenly she’s seeing her own future? Is this a sci-fi movie or a therapy session?

Screenwriter Guy: No, it’s all connected! The aliens are here to give humanity a gift. A weapon, essentially, that humanity needs in the future.

Producer Guy: So, they just show up, teach a professor to see the future with their fancy circular writing, and then bounce? And we’re supposed to believe this is a big deal? What are they even here for, the aliens? Are they just being helpful?

Screenwriter Guy: Well, it turns out they need our help in 3,000 years. So they’re giving us this gift now, so we can help them later.

Producer Guy: So, it’s a time travel paradox wrapped in an alien encounter, all powered by a linguist learning how to draw circles? This is… surprisingly complicated. What’s the ending? Does she save the world by, like, writing a really polite note to the general?

Screenwriter Guy: She has to use her knowledge of the future to convince a Chinese general to back down and unite the world.

Producer Guy: She… *convinces* a general? With words? Not with, like, a giant laser cannon or a dramatic speech over the world’s airwaves? Just… a conversation? That’s… certainly a choice.

Producer Guy: You know what, this sounds like it could be a real thinker. People like movies that make them feel smart, even if they don’t quite understand what’s happening. I think it’s got potential.
