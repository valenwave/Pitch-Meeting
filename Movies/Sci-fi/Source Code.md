Producer Guy: So you have a movie for me?

Screenwriter Guy: Yes sir, I do! It's called *Source Code*.

Producer Guy: *Source Code*. Is it like… about computers? Because we just did *Tron: Legacy* and… well, it made some money.

Screenwriter Guy: Not exactly, sir. It's about a man who wakes up on a train.

Producer Guy: Okay, a train. Is it like… *Unstoppable*? Because that was pretty good. Denzel, you know.

Screenwriter Guy: No, no. He wakes up, and he's not sure how he got there. And the woman across from him, who he doesn't know, acts like they're good friends.

Producer Guy: So he has amnesia? Is it like *The Bourne Identity*? Because that made *a lot* of money. Matt Damon, you know.

Screenwriter Guy: Well, sort of. But then the train explodes!

Producer Guy: Whoa! So it's an action movie? Like *Speed*? Because *Speed* was awesome. Keanu, you know.

Screenwriter Guy: Not exactly, because then he wakes up again in a dark pod-like room, and a woman on a screen tells him he's part of a top-secret program.

Producer Guy: A pod-like room? Is it like *The Matrix*? Because that made *so much* money. Keanu again, you know.

Screenwriter Guy: Not really. He's actually in this program called "Source Code," and he's reliving the last eight minutes of a man's life to find a bomber.

Producer Guy: So he keeps reliving the same eight minutes? Like *Groundhog Day*? Because that was a classic. Bill Murray, you know.

Screenwriter Guy: Yes! Exactly like *Groundhog Day*, but with a train explosion and a terrorist! And he has to keep going back until he finds the bomber.

Producer Guy: So, he's like, solving a mystery while also in a time loop? And he falls in love with the woman on the train even though she's not real, because he's technically experiencing someone else's life?

Screenwriter Guy: Exactly! And there's a ticking clock, and high stakes! And a twist ending where he actually… well, I don't want to spoil it, but it's pretty mind-bending.

Producer Guy: Hmm. A man on a train, repeatedly dying, trying to stop a bomb, with a touch of romance, and a big sci-fi twist. You know what? I think this could actually work. It's got elements of everything people like! I think this could be a sleeper hit.
