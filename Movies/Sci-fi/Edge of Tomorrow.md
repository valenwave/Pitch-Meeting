### Scene: Pitch Meeting - Warner Bros. Executive Boardroom

**Producer Guy:** Alright, so what do you got for me today? Feeling frisky for some high-concept sci-fi, or are we sticking to safe bets, like another superhero origin story where the hero has a slightly different shade of red?

**Screenwriter Guy:** Oh, this is *definitely* high-concept, sir. It's an alien invasion movie, right? But with a twist!

**Producer Guy:** A twist? Okay, I'm listening. Is it like, the aliens are actually just trying to deliver a pizza? Because that was my idea last week, and you guys said it was "too niche."

**Screenwriter Guy:** No, no. So, humanity is fighting these terrifying aliens, the Mimics, and we're losing. Badly. Our hero, Major William Cage – he's a PR guy, never seen combat – gets thrown into this massive D-Day style invasion. He dies, right? But then... he wakes up. At the beginning of the same day.

**Producer Guy:** Woah, woah, woah. So he’s in a time loop? Like *Groundhog Day*? But with aliens?

**Screenwriter Guy:** Exactly! Every time he dies, he resets. He’s forced to relive the same brutal battle over and over again.

**Producer Guy:** So he just… keeps dying? That sounds a little depressing for a big summer blockbuster. Are we going for the "audience feels existential dread" demographic now?

**Screenwriter Guy:** No, that's the genius of it! With each death, he learns. He gets better. He figures out how the aliens work, he gets stronger, he becomes this super-soldier. He even teams up with this legendary warrior, Rita Vrataski, who's been through the same thing!

**Producer Guy:** So, basically, he's playing a video game? With infinite lives? And his save point is the beginning of the level? And the boss is the "Omega" Mimic, which is like, the final boss?

**Screenwriter Guy:** (Nods enthusiastically) Pretty much! And Rita, she's his tough-as-nails mentor. She even shoots him in the head sometimes just to reset the day quicker so they can try a new strategy!

**Producer Guy:** (Raises an eyebrow) She *shoots* him in the head? To help him? That’s… that’s one way to motivate a soldier. I'm picturing the training montage now. "Alright, Cage, you messed up that flank. Time for your nap. BLAM!"

**Screenwriter Guy:** It’s darkly humorous! And it adds to the stakes because eventually, he loses the ability to reset. So the final fight, when he finally gets to the Omega, it's all or nothing!

**Producer Guy:** So, he goes from being a coward who’s never seen combat to a one-man army, thanks to dying thousands of times. And the audience is supposed to just… accept this very literal "learning by doing" plot device? And we’re calling it *Edge of Tomorrow*? What does that even mean? Is it like the edge of tomorrow, where tomorrow never comes because he keeps reliving today?

**Screenwriter Guy:** It's metaphorical! And the "Live. Die. Repeat." tagline really drives it home!

**Producer Guy:** "Live. Die. Repeat." Huh. That’s catchy. Could even put it on the home video release. You know, since the title itself isn't exactly screaming "time loop alien action fun." And we got Tom Cruise, right? He's good at running. He can run from the aliens, he can run towards the aliens, he can run in a loop. Lots of running.

**Screenwriter Guy:** He's perfect for it! And Emily Blunt is incredible as Rita. Their chemistry really sells the endless cycle of fighting and fleeting connection.

**Producer Guy:** Alright, alright. I like the sound of it. A fresh take on the alien invasion genre, a compelling gimmick, and two big stars. This has the potential to be a real sleeper hit. People might not get it at first, but word of mouth could really build.
