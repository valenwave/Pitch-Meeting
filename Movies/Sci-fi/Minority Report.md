**INT. PRODUCER GUY'S OFFICE - DAY**

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, what have you got for me today? Feeling like something… prescient?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Oh, you know it! We've got a killer idea, literally. It's called *Minority Report*.

**PRODUCER GUY:** *Minority Report*. Sounds like something I get from my doctor after I've eaten too much sushi. What's the pitch?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Okay, so it's 2054, and murder has been eliminated. Completely. Because of PreCrime! We have these three psychics, or "PreCogs," who can see murders before they happen. Like, literally visualize them.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, we arrest people for crimes they *will* commit? Not have committed?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly! It's genius! No more murder. It's a perfect system. And our hero, John Anderton, he's the head of the PreCrime unit. He's super good at it. Very efficient. He uses these futuristic gloves to swipe through the PreCogs' visions, like he's conducting an orchestra made of future murder.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, a police chief who's also a… conductor? And he's going to be played by Tom Cruise, right? Because when you say "efficient," I think "Tom Cruise running really fast."

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, yes, obviously Tom Cruise. He's perfect for the role. Anyway, the system's about to go national, it's been so successful in D.C. But then… plot twist! The PreCogs have a vision, and it's John Anderton himself! He's going to murder a man he doesn't even know in 36 hours!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wait, so the guy who stops all the murders... is going to commit one? But if he's seen it, doesn't that change the future? Isn't that the whole point of seeing the future? So you *don't* do it?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, that's the central philosophical question of the movie! Free will versus determinism! Is his future already set, or can he change it? He goes on the run, obviously. And he needs new eyeballs because the city has eye scanners everywhere.

**PRODUCER GUY:** New eyeballs. Got it. So we're gonna have a scene where Tom Cruise gets his eyes scooped out by some back-alley surgeon?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Uh, yeah! It's super gross and memorable! Then he has to carry his old eyeballs around in a bag so he can still access his old PreCrime building!

**PRODUCER GUY:** So he's got eyes in his hands, but not in his head. And he's running from the very system he created. This is getting delightfully convoluted. How does he get around a futuristic city when everyone's being tracked by their eyeballs?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He uses those cool magnetic cars that drive themselves! And there's this incredible chase sequence with jetpacks, and then he ends up in a car factory, where he’s trying to escape these spider-like robots that scan everyone's retinas to find him.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Spider robots that scan your eyes. Wow. So basically, the future is just a bunch of fancy ways to get your personal data? Sounds… familiar. What about the "minority report" part of the title?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Oh, right! See, sometimes, one of the PreCogs has a different vision from the other two. It's a "minority report." And that's the key to John's innocence, if he can find it! He kidnaps Agatha, the most powerful of the PreCogs, and she helps him. She's, like, super traumatized from all the future murders she sees.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So he kidnaps a psychic, who's also a traumatized, mute woman? And she's going to guide him through a city that wants his eyeballs? This movie is a lot.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It's got layers! And it turns out, the whole thing is a conspiracy! The head of PreCrime, his mentor, is actually behind it! He set up John Anderton to kill this guy because he needed the system to keep running perfectly, and John was getting too close to the truth about a past murder!

**PRODUCER GUY:** So the entire premise of the movie, that the system is perfect, is undermined by the guy who runs the system being a murderer? Bold choice. So, what, the bad guy just confesses to all of it in the end?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Pretty much! And then there’s a whole bit about a drowning murder that looks like an echo but wasn’t, and it’s all tied into the original trauma of one of the PreCogs! It's a very satisfying reveal!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Okay, so, we've got Tom Cruise, eye-scanners, spider robots, jetpacks, a psychic in a bath, a big conspiracy, and a lot of running. This sounds like it could be a massive hit. People love Tom Cruise running and things exploding. And a little bit of deep philosophical pondering, just enough to make them feel smart. Yeah, I think this will do quite well.
