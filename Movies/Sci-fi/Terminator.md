(Cut to a boardroom. PRODUCER GUY is sitting at a large table, looking bored. SCREENWRITER GUY bursts in, enthusiastic.)

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So, I have this idea for a movie!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, really? Another one? Is it about a talking dog who solves mysteries? Because we've already got twenty of those in development.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, no, this is different! It's an action sci-fi thriller!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Intriguing. Go on.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Okay, so in the future, machines take over and fight a war against humanity. And they send a killer robot back in time to kill the mother of the future resistance leader.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, a robot... from the future... to kill a woman... in the past. But why not just send, like, a regular assassin? Why a robot?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Because it's a *killer robot*! It's cool! And it's basically indestructible!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Okay, so it's indestructible. How do you stop it?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, it gets hit by a truck, then blown up by a tanker truck, then an actual explosion at a factory, and then it's crushed in a hydraulic press.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So it's *not* indestructible? Sounds like it's pretty destructible. Like, super destructible, actually.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, it's *hard* to kill! And then there's this other guy, also from the future, who's sent back to protect her!

**PRODUCER GUY:** So he's also a robot?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, he's a human! He's a soldier! And he falls in love with her!

**PRODUCER GUY:** So the guy sent to *protect* her, the future resistance leader's mother, ends up being the *father* of the future resistance leader? Isn't that... a bit circular? Like, if he doesn't go back, she doesn't get pregnant, and the resistance leader isn't born, so he wouldn't need to go back in the first place?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah, it's, uh... a paradox! It's deep!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Or it's just really confusing. So, what's the robot's name?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** The Terminator.

**PRODUCER GUY:** The... Terminator. And what does it look like?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, it's a metal skeleton with red eyes, but for most of the movie, it's covered in human flesh so it looks like a regular guy. And it's played by a bodybuilder with a thick Austrian accent.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A bodybuilder... with an Austrian accent... playing a robot... trying to blend in? Are we sure about that?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He says "I'll be back!" It's gonna be iconic!

**PRODUCER GUY:** (Sighs) You know what? I'm starting to think this could actually work. It's got robots, time travel, a love story... It's got all the ingredients for a box office hit.

**SCREENWRASER GUY:** So it's a green light?

**PRODUCER GUY:** Yeah, sure, green light it. What's the worst that could happen?
