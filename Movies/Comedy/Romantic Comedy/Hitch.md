**PRODUCER GUY:** So, you have a movie for me?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes sir, I do. It’s a romantic comedy about a guy who helps other guys get the girl of their dreams.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, a matchmaker.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, no, he’s much cooler than that. He’s a professional “date doctor.” We’re gonna call him Hitch, and we’ll get Will Smith to play him.

**PRODUCER GUY:** The Fresh Prince is helping nerds get girlfriends? I like it.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly! So the movie opens with him giving advice to this one guy through an earpiece on a date, and it totally works. He’s super smooth, super successful, and totally anonymous.

**PRODUCER GUY:** It’s gotta be tough to stay anonymous if your whole business is based on word of mouth.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Super easy, barely an inconvenience.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, really?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah, so his new client is this schlubby, clumsy accountant named Albert Brennaman. He’s hopelessly in love with this super famous, gorgeous, and incredibly wealthy celebrity named Allegra Cole.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wait, so a bumbling accountant wants to date a mega-celebrity who is way out of his league?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** That’s the magic of the movie! Hitch is going to teach him how to be confident. There’ll be a whole montage of him teaching Albert how to dance. It’s going to be hilarious.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So this rich and famous woman is just going to fall for the accountant because he learned a few dance moves?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, he also learns how to whistle with his fingers to get a cab. Except he can't do it, so he just yells "TAXI!" really loud. But she finds it charming!

**PRODUCER GUY:** She’s charmed by his inability to do a basic thing Hitch taught him. Got it.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So while Hitch is helping Albert, he meets this woman, Sara, who’s a gossip columnist. And he’s instantly smitten, but he has to hide his real job from her.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, so the guy who teaches other people how to be smooth with women is going to be a complete mess when it comes to his own love life?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** You know it! On their first date, he takes her on a jet ski tour to Ellis Island, and he accidentally kicks her into the water.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wow wow wow… wow. Smooth.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Then later, they go out for dinner and he has a massive allergic reaction to some seafood. His entire face swells up like a balloon. He looks like a monster.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So his face becomes a special effect?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes! And he has to run to a pharmacy and chug a bottle of Benadryl, which makes him super drowsy, and he ends up passing out after she kisses him.

**PRODUCER GUY:** This is the most romantic thing I have ever heard.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So things are going great with Albert and Allegra, and surprisingly well with Hitch and Sara. But then, Sara’s best friend gets her heart broken by this scumbag who, it turns out, used Hitch’s services.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh no! A conflict!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yep. So Sara, being a gossip columnist, decides to investigate this mysterious "date doctor." And she finds out it's Hitch! And even worse, she realizes Albert is one of his clients and thinks his whole relationship with her friend Allegra is a lie.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Yikes. It’s going to be tough for him to escape that.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Actually, it’s going to be super easy, barely an inconvenience.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, really?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah, see, after she writes a huge exposé that ruins his career and their relationship, Hitch confronts her. He gives this big, passionate speech about how he only helps good guys who are afraid, and that 90% of what he does is just getting them to listen.

**PRODUCER GUY:** And she just believes him after he lied to her the entire time they were dating?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, yeah! He’s really earnest about it. And at the same time, Albert goes and has his own heartfelt conversation with Allegra where he confesses everything and she realizes he’s a genuine, sweet guy who just needed a little help.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So a couple of good speeches just solves everything?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Pretty much! Hitch and Sara get back together, and the movie ends with Albert and Allegra’s wedding, where everyone is dancing.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A romantic comedy with Will Smith and Kevin James where everyone ends up happy and dancing? This sounds like printing money.
