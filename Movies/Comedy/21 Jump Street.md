**PRODUCER GUY:** So you have a movie for me?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes sir, I do. It’s a reboot of an old TV show.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, rebooting beloved properties is tight! Which one are we doing?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** 21 Jump Street.

**PRODUCER GUY:** The one that launched Johnny Depp's career? Are we getting him to do a cameo?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes, and he’s going to get killed off almost immediately.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wow, wow, wow. So who’s our new dynamic duo?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So I was thinking we get Jonah Hill to play the nerdy guy, Schmidt, and Channing Tatum as the popular jock, Jenko.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Channing Tatum in a comedy? Is that a good idea?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It will be, sir. He’s surprisingly funny. So, they were enemies in high school, but then they meet again at the police academy and become friends.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A classic odd couple pairing. I like it.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So they mess up their first big arrest because they forgot to read the guy his Miranda rights.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Forgetting to do the most famous part of being a cop seems like a major screw-up.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It is, so they get reassigned to a revived undercover program that sends young-looking cops back to high school.

**PRODUCER GUY:** And these two look young enough to pass for high schoolers?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Absolutely not. And we're going to make a bunch of jokes about it.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Self-aware humor is super easy, barely an inconvenience.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So their mission is to find the supplier of a new synthetic drug called HFS.

**PRODUCER GUY:** What does HFS stand for?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Holy F\*\*\*ing S\*\*\*.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, so it’s one of those edgy comedies.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It is. So they go undercover, but they mix up their identities. Schmidt, the nerd, ends up taking the easy classes and becomes popular, while Jenko, the jock, is stuck with theAP science kids.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A classic fish-out-of-water scenario, but with two fish.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly! And Schmidt starts to fall for a girl named Molly.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Let me guess, she’s involved with the drug dealer.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** You got it. Her boyfriend, Eric, is the main dealer. So Schmidt and Jenko have to get in with his crew. They even throw a huge house party to gain their trust.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A party thrown by undercover cops? What could possibly go wrong?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Everything. But it works! Eric invites Schmidt into his inner circle. But then Schmidt and Jenko start to drift apart because they’re getting too into their high school personas.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Ah, the classic “we’re partners but now we’re fighting” trope.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It’s a staple for a reason, sir. So, they eventually track the source of the drugs to the P.E. teacher.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Of course, it’s the P.E. teacher. They’re always so suspicious.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** And the motorcycle gang they failed to arrest at the beginning of the movie are the suppliers.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, so it all comes full circle. That's some neat writing.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So there’s a big shootout at the prom. And that’s where we have the Johnny Depp cameo. He and Peter DeLuise show up as their original characters, also undercover.

**PRODUCER GUY:** And then they get shot?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Immediately. So Schmidt and Jenko chase the teacher and Eric, who have kidnapped Molly. There’s a big limo chase, lots of explosions.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Sounds expensive.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Super easy, barely an inconvenience. So, Jenko takes a bullet for Schmidt, and Schmidt, in turn, saves the day by confronting his fear of public speaking and successfully reading the Miranda rights this time.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Character development is tight!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So they bring down the drug ring, get the girl, and are heroes. And then their captain, played by Ice Cube, gives them a new assignment.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A sequel hook!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** You know it. He tells them they’re going to college.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Well, it sounds like a fun, self-aware action-comedy. It’ll probably do pretty well.
