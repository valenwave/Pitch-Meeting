Producer Guy: So, we got a new *Knives Out* movie. What's the pitch?

Screenwriter Guy: Okay, so, it’s called *Glass Onion*.

Producer Guy: *Glass Onion*? Like the Beatles song? Is it a musical?

Screenwriter Guy: No, no. It’s a metaphor, you see. For layers. Things that seem complex but are actually… simple.

Producer Guy: *Simple*? We just made a gazillion dollars on a *complex* murder mystery. People like puzzles! They like to feel smart!

Screenwriter Guy: Well, this one, the twist is, it’s not that complicated. The clues are right there. In plain sight.

Producer Guy: (Sighs) So, it’s a dumb mystery. Got it. Who's our detective this time?

Screenwriter Guy: Benoit Blanc is back!

Producer Guy: Oh, good, good. Daniel Craig. People love that accent. Is he still wearing fancy scarves?

Screenwriter Guy: Absolutely. And this time, he’s bored in his bathtub during the pandemic, doing Zoom calls with Angela Lansbury and Stephen Sondheim.

Producer Guy: (Eyes light up) Angela Lansbury and Stephen Sondheim?! Okay, that’s good! That’s *very* good! So, he gets a case, right? A real brain-teaser.

Screenwriter Guy: He gets invited to a private Greek island for a murder mystery party hosted by a tech billionaire named Miles Bron.

Producer Guy: A tech billionaire? So, like, a less charming Elon Musk?

Screenwriter Guy: Exactly! He’s got a group of "disruptors" with him. A politician, a fashion mogul, a men's rights streamer…

Producer Guy: A men's rights streamer? Is he played by Dave Bautista?

Screenwriter Guy: He is! And he has a girlfriend named Whiskey.

Producer Guy: Whiskey? Are we going for subtle symbolism here? Because this doesn't feel subtle.

Screenwriter Guy: It's all part of the fun! Anyway, Miles sets up this elaborate murder mystery game, but then someone actually dies. And it’s not who you expect.

Producer Guy: (Leans forward) Ooh, a real death! Good! So Blanc is on the case, peeling back the layers of this... glass onion.

Screenwriter Guy: Precisely! And we do a big flashback in the middle to show you exactly what happened.

Producer Guy: A flashback? So, we show the murder? Wouldn’t that… ruin the mystery?

Screenwriter Guy: Not if you’re focusing on the wrong things! The real mystery isn't *who* did it, it's *how* it all comes together. And why these people are so awful.

Producer Guy: So, it’s a social commentary, too? We’re going to get preachy?

Screenwriter Guy: Not preachy! Just… pointing out the obvious. About how billionaires are maybe not always the geniuses they think they are. And how their friends are often just enablers.

Producer Guy: (Sighs, rubs temples) Okay, so we've got a slightly dumbed-down mystery, a social critique, and Angela Lansbury. What's the climax? Does the house explode?

Screenwriter Guy: Well, there's a valuable painting that gets… well, it gets destroyed. And the mansion goes up in flames.

Producer Guy: The *Mona Lisa* gets destroyed?! And a mansion explodes?! That's a lot of property damage! People will love that! So, is it just Benoit Blanc again for the next one? Or do we bring back some of these… disruptors?

Screenwriter Guy: No, no. New cast, new location every time. Benoit Blanc is the through-line. Like Hercule Poirot, but with more linen.

Producer Guy: Linen. Right. As long as it makes a pile of cash, I don’t care if he solves it wearing a banana costume. Let's make another one!
