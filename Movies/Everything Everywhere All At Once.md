**PRODUCER GUY:** So you have a new action movie for me?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes sir, I do. It’s about a middle-aged Chinese immigrant woman who has to save the multiverse.

**PRODUCER GUY:** The multiverse, huh? That’s a hot-ticket item right now. So she’s like a superhero?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Not at all. She runs a failing laundromat with her husband, her daughter is disappointed in her, her dad is visiting and criticizing her, and she's being audited by the IRS.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, so it’s a depressing family drama about taxes.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It is, for a little bit. So our hero, Evelyn, is at the IRS building with her family, and the auditor is this very stern woman named Deirdre.

**PRODUCER GUY:** This sounds terrible. When does the action start?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Right now! See, while they’re in the elevator, Evelyn’s meek husband Waymond suddenly changes. His personality flips, he starts doing martial arts, and he tells her he’s from another universe, the Alpha-verse, and she’s the only one who can stop a great evil from destroying everything.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, another universe version of a character showing up is tight!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It is! And he tells her she needs to access the skills of her other-universe selves to fight.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So she just instantly knows kung fu now?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Actually, it's super easy, barely an inconvenience.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, really?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah, see, to tap into another Evelyn’s skills, she just has to do something statistically improbable. Like, to learn kung fu, she has to tell the IRS agent she loves her.

**PRODUCER GUY:** She has to do what now?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** She has to profess her love to the woman auditing her. Or to get other skills she might have to eat a tube of chapstick, or give herself four paper cuts between her fingers.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So the whole mechanic of the movie is that people have to do really weird, random stuff to get powers?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** That's the idea!

[cite_start]**PRODUCER GUY:** I am going to spend real money on making this into a real movie. [cite: 536] So who is this great evil she has to fight?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Her name is Jobu Tupaki. She's an all-powerful being who can experience every universe at once and wants to destroy everything.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh boy, sounds scary. What’s her deal?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, she’s actually a version of Evelyn’s daughter, Joy. And she created a weapon to destroy the multiverse.

**PRODUCER GUY:** What is it? A cosmic death ray? An anti-life equation?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** An everything bagel.

**PRODUCER GUY:** ...A bagel.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yep. It has everything on it, so it creates a black hole that will consume all of reality.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A villainous bagel. Wow wow wow wow. I'm assuming there are going to be some big fights?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Oh yeah. There’s a scene where Waymond from the Alpha-verse fights a bunch of security guards using only his fanny pack.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Fighting people with a fanny pack is TIGHT.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** And Evelyn will jump into a universe where she's a famous martial arts movie star. And then one where she’s a hibachi chef. And then one where everyone has hot dogs for fingers.

**PRODUCER GUY:** I’m sorry, a universe where people have what for fingers?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Hot dogs. Long, floppy hot dogs. And in that universe, Evelyn is in a romantic relationship with the IRS agent, who plays the piano beautifully with her feet.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Why would she play with her feet?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Because she has hot dogs for fingers, sir. Try to keep up.

**PRODUCER GUY:** I have so many questions.

[cite_start]**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Hey, shut up about all of them. [cite: 130] So Jobu Tupaki can basically do anything, and she’s trying to get Evelyn to join her in the bagel of nihilistic despair. There’s also going to be a universe where Evelyn is a piñata.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Okay.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** And a universe where a hibachi chef is controlled by a raccoon hiding in his hat, just like Ratatouille.

**PRODUCER GUY:** You’re going to call him Racacoonie, aren’t you?

[cite_start]**SCREENWRITER GUY:** I intend to hit it. [cite: 178] Then we’ll have a scene where Evelyn and Joy are just two rocks in a silent, barren universe, and they have a very emotional conversation via subtitles.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So we’re just gonna stop the big, weird action movie to watch rocks with captions for a few minutes?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It’s an emotional climax!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Fair enough. So how does she beat the all-powerful daughter-bagel-lady?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, Evelyn realizes that she can fight the same way Jobu does, by accessing all her skills at once. But instead of fighting with violence, she fights with kindness and empathy. She figures out what everyone is missing in their lives and gives it to them.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Aww, she kills them with kindness. That’s sweet.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** And she helps one guy win a fight by figuring out how to get a big award-shaped butt plug up his...

[cite_start]**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh my God! [cite: 120] So she beats the bad guys and saves the day?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Pretty much! She convinces Joy that there's still good in the world and pulls her back from the brink of the bagel. She accepts her daughter for who she is, reconnects with her husband, and even manages to sort out her taxes.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wow. So it’s a multiverse action-comedy martial arts movie that’s also an immigrant family drama about learning to love each other and overcoming nihilism, featuring hot dog fingers, butt plugs, and a raccoon chef?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** That’s the one! So what do you think?

**PRODUCER GUY:** This is the strangest, most chaotic thing I have ever heard in my life. It's either going to confuse everyone and fail spectacularly, or it's going to be one of the most beloved movies of all time.
