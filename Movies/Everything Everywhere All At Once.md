## Everything Everywhere All At Once

**INT. MOVIE PITCH MEETING - DAY**

**PRODUCER GUY:** Alright, so what do you got for me? Give me something fresh!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Okay, so it’s about a Chinese-American laundromat owner named Evelyn. Her life is kind of falling apart, she’s facing an IRS audit, her marriage is struggling, and she’s got a strained relationship with her daughter.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Sounds… uplifting. Where’s the blockbuster appeal here? Is it a dramedy? Because I’m picturing a lot of laundry baskets.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, no! See, during the IRS audit, she suddenly discovers she can access different versions of herself from the multiverse!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Whoa, whoa, whoa. Multiverse? Like, Marvel multiverse? Is she a superhero? Does she put on a spandex suit? Because I got a guy for spandex.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Not exactly a spandex suit. She learns to "verse-jump" by doing really bizarre, statistically improbable things. Like, she has to swap her shoes from one foot to the other, or eat a stick of chapstick.

**PRODUCER GUY:** (Raises an eyebrow) Eating chapstick gives you superpowers? Is this a public service announcement for lip balm? Because I don't think that's how that works.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It gives her access to the skills and memories of other Evelyns! So, in one universe, she’s a kung fu master. In another, she’s a famous movie star.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, she's an immigrant laundromat owner who suddenly knows kung fu because she ate chapstick? And she's famous in another life? This sounds like a fever dream I had after eating too much dim sum. What’s the conflict? Is she fighting the IRS with kung fu?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** She's fighting an incredibly powerful, nihilistic entity named Jobu Tupaki, who is actually a version of her own daughter, Joy, from another universe! Jobu created an "Everything Bagel" that could destroy the multiverse because she's experienced everything and nothing matters to her anymore.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wait, so the villain is an everything bagel? Like, with cream cheese? Is this a comedy about breakfast pastries? And her daughter is the bagel? How does that work? Does she turn into a giant bagel?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, the Everything Bagel is like a black hole, a singularity that sucks everything in. And Jobu Tupaki is super powerful because her mind was splintered after her Alpha-Evelyn pushed her too hard to verse-jump. So she experiences all universes at once and it drove her to despair.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, it's about generational trauma, immigrant struggles, existential nihilism, *and* kung fu fights with fanny packs, and a talking raccoon chef, and people with hot dogs for fingers? This sounds like you just threw a bunch of darts at a whiteboard filled with random concepts.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** But it all ties together! It's about a mother learning to accept her daughter, and finding meaning and kindness in a chaotic world, even when nothing makes sense!

**PRODUCER GUY:** (Sighs) Alright, alright. I'll give you this, it's... ambitious. And weird. Really, *really* weird. But sometimes weird works. People like weird, right? As long as it's not *too* weird. I mean, the hot dog fingers are pushing it, but the kung fu could be marketable. Let’s make it. I think it could do... alright. Maybe it'll be a little indie hit, get some good reviews from the weird film crowd.
