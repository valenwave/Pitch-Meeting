**PRODUCER GUY:** So, you have an Everything Everywhere All at Once movie for me?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes, sir, I do.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh boy, so it's a multiverse movie, huh? I love those. It's like one of the only things we do anymore. It's a gold mine. So what are the heroes?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, the main hero is this woman named Evelyn Wang. She's a Chinese-American immigrant who runs a laundromat.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, so she's a laundromat owner, and she's a hero who's going to save the multiverse, right?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** That's right. And her husband, Waymond, also helps out. He's a very kind and gentle man.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, okay. And what about the villain? Is it some sort of powerful sorcerer, or maybe a rogue A.I.?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, sir. It's a version of her daughter from another universe, named Jobu Tupaki.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, a daughter-villain, huh? Interesting dynamic. So what's her evil plan?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, she's trying to destroy the multiverse with a bagel.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A bagel?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah, an Everything Bagel. It's a black-hole-like singularity that contains everything in the multiverse.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, those are words! So she's trying to destroy all of reality with an everything bagel, and she's the daughter of the hero. Why is she so mad?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Because in another universe, her mom pushed her too hard to do multiversal stuff, and it broke her mind, so now she experiences all universes at once.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Ah, so the villain is an allegory for depression and generational trauma.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yep. So Evelyn has to learn how to verse-jump, which is how you access the skills of your alternate selves.

**PRODUCER GUY:** How do you verse-jump? Do you touch a special crystal or do a little dance?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, you have to perform a statistically unlikely or bizarre action, like putting googly eyes on your forehead or switching your shoes from one foot to the other.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh my god. Okay. So, she has to fight the villain with all these powers she's gaining, but what's the emotional core of the film?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, she's trying to save her family. And also, she's being audited by the IRS.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A multiverse-threatening bagel and a tax audit? Those are some high stakes. So, the IRS agent must be, like, the most evil person in the world, right?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, not at all. She's a good person. And Evelyn learns to use kindness and empathy to fight the bad guys instead of violence.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Fighting with kindness. That's a bold move. So how does this whole saga end? Does she defeat her daughter?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, she saves her. She convinces Jobu that even though nothing matters, their relationship and the simple things in their lives do.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So the whole movie is about a mom accepting her daughter and fighting a nihilistic bagel with kindness. I love it! That's going to do great!
