**PRODUCER GUY:** So you have a teen romantic comedy for me?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes sir, I do! I was thinking we do a modern-day adaptation of a Shakespeare play.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, are teens super into Shakespeare these days?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, no, so we're going to hide the Shakespeare part. We'll set it in a high school and cast a bunch of attractive up-and-coming actors. The story is based on "The Taming of the Shrew."

**PRODUCER GUY:** Taming a shrew, you say? That sounds a little problematic for modern audiences.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Oh, don't worry, we'll make her a cool, feminist, indie-rock-loving shrew.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A marketable shrew. I love it.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So there are these two sisters, the Stratfords. The younger one, Bianca, is super popular and wants to date, but the older one, Kat, is terrifying and hates everyone.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So she's the shrew.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly. And their dad is an OB-GYN who is so scared of them getting pregnant that he makes a new rule: Bianca can only date when Kat does.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Which she never will, because she's famously hateful. That dad is playing chess while everyone else is playing checkers.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He sure is. So this new kid, Cameron, shows up and immediately falls for Bianca. But he can't take her out because of the rule.

**PRODUCER GUY:** The Kat rule. A classic obstacle.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yep. So Cameron and his new friend Michael come up with a plan. They need to find someone to date Kat.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Just find a guy for the angry sister. How hard can that be?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Actually, it's going to be super easy, barely an inconvenience.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, really?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah, see, they decide to pay someone. They get the school's rich jerk, Joey Donner, who also wants to date Bianca, to put up the cash. And they find the perfect candidate: Patrick Verona.

**PRODUCER GUY:** And what's his deal?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He's the school's mysterious bad boy. There are all these rumors about him, like he ate a live duck once.

**PRODUCER GUY:** He ate a whole duck?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Feathers and all, apparently. So he takes Joey's money and agrees to take Kat out.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Paying a bad boy to date an angry girl so another guy can date her sister. This is delightfully convoluted.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It is! So Patrick starts trying to win Kat over. He shows up at her indie rock clubs, they have witty banter, and he even gets her to go to a party.

**PRODUCER GUY:** And at this party, I assume they fall deeply in love over some punch.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Not exactly. Kat gets super drunk, flashes a teacher, dances on a table, and then throws up. But Patrick is a gentleman and drives her home safely.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Taking care of a drunk person is tight!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Then he arranges a paintball date! They have a blast and end up kissing for the first time.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wow wow wow wow. Romance!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** But his biggest move is yet to come. To apologize for being a jerk, he gets the school marching band to help him perform "Can't Take My Eyes Off You" on the stadium bleachers while she's at soccer practice. He's running from security guards and everything.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A public serenade with a brass section? That's the most romantic thing I've ever heard! I'm going to need a moment.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So it works, and Kat agrees to go to the prom with him. Meanwhile, Bianca has been going out with Cameron, and she realizes Joey is just a shallow model.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So everyone is happy and goes to prom and the movie ends?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Nope! At the prom, Joey gets mad that Bianca won't go with him, so he tells Kat that he paid Patrick to date her.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh no! The truth! My one weakness!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Kat is completely heartbroken. The next day in English class, she's asked to read a poem she wrote. It's called "10 Things I Hate About You."

**PRODUCER GUY:** That's the name of the movie!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It is! And she reads this whole list of things she hates about Patrick, but the last line is, "But mostly I hate the way I don't hate you. Not even close, not even a little bit, not even at all." She starts crying and runs out of the class.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh man, that's heavy. So he's got to win her back now.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He sure does. He finds her at her car and reveals that he used Joey's money to buy her the guitar she'd been wanting.

**PRODUCER GUY:** He bought her a thoughtful gift with the jerk's money! That's a power move!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It is! They kiss, the band from the movie starts playing, and everything is great. So what do you think?

**PRODUCER GUY:** A teen movie based on Shakespeare starring a bunch of charming young actors that will probably all become huge stars? It's smart, it's funny, it's romantic. I think people are going to love this.
