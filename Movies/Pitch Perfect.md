**PRODUCER GUY:** So, you have a movie for me?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes sir, I do. It’s a musical comedy about the intense, high-stakes world of collegiate a cappella.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Aca-scuse me? Did you say collegiate a cappella?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** I did! See? The puns write themselves.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wow. So what’s the story?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** We open on the Barden Bellas, an all-girl a cappella group, at the national championship. But then, disaster strikes. Their leader, Aubrey, gets stage fright and projectile vomits all over the stage.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh my god! That’s disgusting! I love it! What happens then?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, four months later, the Bellas are a campus laughingstock and they need new members. We meet our main character, Beca. She’s an aspiring music producer who would rather be in LA, but her professor dad is forcing her to go to college for a year.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So she’s too cool for school. Got it.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly. She joins the Bellas to appease her dad, along with a group of other misfits. There's a girl who speaks so quietly you can’t hear her, a girl who is overly sexual, and an Australian girl who calls herself "Fat Amy."

**PRODUCER GUY:** She calls herself Fat Amy?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah, so "twig bitches" don't do it behind her back.

**PRODUCER GUY:** That’s actually brilliant. This character is going to be a star.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** I think so too. Anyway, the group is run by Aubrey, the vomiter, and her much nicer friend, Chloe. Aubrey is super strict and insists they use the same setlist of old songs that failed them last year.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Sounds like a recipe for success.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Beca thinks they should modernize their sound, but Aubrey refuses. Also, Beca starts a flirty rivalry with Jesse, a guy from the all-male rival group, the Treblemakers.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Aca-dorable. So there's some romance.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Of course. There's also a scene where all the a cappella groups meet in an empty pool at night for a spontaneous singing battle called a Riff-Off.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A Riff-Off in an empty pool? Why is it empty?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So their voices echo better, probably. Anyway, Beca shows off her skills, but the Bellas lose on a technicality.

**PRODUCER GUY:** The drama is palpable. So how do they get to the finals?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, at the semi-finals, Aubrey insists on the old, boring setlist again. But Beca, in a moment of rebellion, improvises and mashes up another song into the performance. The crowd loves it, but Aubrey is furious and kicks Beca out of the group. They end up placing third and don't make the finals.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh no! So the movie is over?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Not quite! It’s going to be super easy, barely an inconvenience for them to get back in.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, really?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah, see, it turns out the lead singer of the second-place group was secretly in high school, so they get disqualified. The Bellas are back in!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wow, that is incredibly convenient!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So Beca rejoins the group, Aubrey finally relinquishes control, and they put together a brand-new, modern mashup for the finals. They perform it, it's amazing, and they beat the Treblemakers to win the national championship. Beca and Jesse also kiss.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wow. So it's every underdog sports movie ever, but with singing instead of sports.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Pretty much.

**PRODUCER GUY:** It’s a formulaic story with quirky characters, catchy pop songs, and a vomit scene. I don't see how this could possibly fail.
