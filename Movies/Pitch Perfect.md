Sure, here is the pitch meeting for *Pitch Perfect*:
**Setting:** A bland, overly-lit office.

**Characters:**

* **PRODUCER GUY:** Mid-fifties, wearing an expensive suit, looking perpetually bored.
* **SCREENWRITER GUY:** Young, enthusiastic, holding a very thick script.

**(SCENE START)**

**PRODUCER GUY:** Alright, so what have you got for me today, *Screenwriter Guy*? Try to keep it quick. My yacht won't polish itself.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** (Grinning) Okay, so get this: it's a musical!

**PRODUCER GUY:** (Sighs deeply) A musical. So, like, *Glee*, but for the big screen?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Even better! It's about collegiate a cappella groups!

**PRODUCER GUY:** (Raises an eyebrow) A capella? So, like, singing without instruments? Just...voices?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly! It's a whole world out there, with fierce rivalries, intense competitions, and a lot of very specific hand movements.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Hand movements, huh? Sounds... riveting. What's the plot? Do they, like, save the world with their vocal harmonies?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Not exactly. Our main character, Beca, she's an aspiring DJ, a bit of an outcast. She gets kinda strong-armed into joining the Barden Bellas, an all-female a cappella group.

**PRODUCER GUY:** "Strong-armed," you say? Is it because they're *that* good?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, their current leader, Aubrey, she's a bit... traditional. And she projectile vomited on stage during last year's finals, which kinda messed things up for them.

**PRODUCER GUY:** (Nods slowly) Ah, yes. The ol' on-stage projectile vomit trope. Always a crowd-pleaser. So, Beca wants to shake things up, but Aubrey wants to stick to their tired old medleys? Is that it?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** You got it! And there's also a rival all-male group, the Treblemakers, led by this arrogant guy named Bumper. And Beca starts to maybe, possibly, kinda like a guy in the Treblemakers.

**PRODUCER GUY:** (Groans) A forbidden collegiate a cappella romance? So original. Does he teach her about classic movies or something equally charmingly dorky?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He does! He wants to give her a "movie-cation"! And there's a character named Fat Amy, who calls herself that so other people can't call her that behind her back! And she's hilarious!

**PRODUCER GUY:** "Fat Amy." Groundbreaking character development. So, these warring vocal groups, they have a big final showdown, I assume? Where they do some kind of crazy mash-up that's never been done before, even though they've been doing these kinds of competitions for decades?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Nailed it! And it's all about finding their own sound, embracing individuality, and the power of friendship! And cups!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Cups?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah, there's a whole song with cups! It's gonna be huge!

**PRODUCER GUY:** (Stares blankly for a moment, then chuckles mirthlessly) Alright, *Screenwriter Guy*. You know what? This sounds absolutely ridiculous. A college musical about singing with no instruments, starring a girl who vomits on stage and another named Fat Amy, with a song about cups. I'm going to greenlight this. I have a good feeling about it.

**(Producer Guy leans back, a sly smirk on his face. Cut to black.)**
