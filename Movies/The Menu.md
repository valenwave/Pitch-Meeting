## The Menu Pitch Meeting

Producer Guy: So, what’s the next big idea? Something with a real… bite to it.

Screenwriter Guy: Okay, so, it’s called **The Menu**. It’s a horror-comedy, psychological thriller, about fine dining.

Producer Guy: (Raises an eyebrow) Fine dining? So, like, a Michelin star chef makes a bad soufflé and everyone dies of disappointment?

Screenwriter Guy: Not exactly. It's about a highly exclusive, super pretentious restaurant on a remote island, run by a celebrity chef named Julian Slowik.

Producer Guy: A celebrity chef! So, like, Gordon Ramsay, but even more intense?

Screenwriter Guy: Way more intense. He’s played by **Ralph Fiennes**. He’s got this almost cult-like devotion from his staff. And the guests, they’re all these super rich, obnoxious people. Food critics, tech bros, a movie star…

Producer Guy: So, we're making fun of rich people? Good. Always a popular choice. Is there an everyman character we can root for?

Screenwriter Guy: Yes! A young woman named Margot, played by **Anya Taylor-Joy**. She’s not supposed to be there; she’s a last-minute substitute for a date. And she’s the only one who sees through all the pomp and circumstance.

Producer Guy: So, she's the voice of the audience. Smart. So, they sit down, they order… what happens? Does the food come alive? Is it cursed?

Screenwriter Guy: No, no. The food is… performance art. Each course is tied to a story, a memory of the chef. And as the night goes on, it becomes clear that this isn't just dinner. It's a meticulously planned, escalating series of events.

Producer Guy: Escalating how? Do they get food poisoning? Is it like *Jaws*, but with a really fancy fish?

Screenwriter Guy: It escalates into a deadly game. The chef has invited these specific people because he believes they’ve all contributed to the degradation of his art, or society in general. And he plans to… eliminate them.

Producer Guy: (Leans forward, intrigued) Eliminate them? As in, murder them? Over dinner? That's dark! I like it! So, it’s like a *Saw* movie, but with amuse-bouches?

Screenwriter Guy: You could say that. There are no actual traps, though. It’s more psychological. Each course reveals more of the chef’s plan, and the guests slowly realize they’re not getting out alive.

Producer Guy: So, what’s the twist? Does Margot save everyone with her quick wit and a perfectly cooked burger?

Screenwriter Guy: Well, she’s the only one who can truly connect with the chef. She doesn’t play by his rules. She’s unimpressed by his pretentiousness, and that throws him off. She actually asks for a cheeseburger.

Producer Guy: A cheeseburger! In a high-end restaurant where people are being murdered! That’s hilarious! So, how does it end? Does everyone die? Or does she escape and open her own, less pretentious, burger joint?

Screenwriter Guy: I can’t tell you *exactly* how it ends, but it’s… fiery. And it’s a commentary on consumerism, artistic integrity, and the divide between the rich and… the rest of us.

Producer Guy: So, we’re back to social commentary again. As long as it's entertaining and visually stunning, I'm in. People love food porn, even if it ends with everyone being immolated. Let's start casting. Do we have anyone in mind for the men's rights streamer who orders a cheeseburger?

Screenwriter Guy: Not in this one, no. But we could always write one in!
