**PRODUCER GUY:** So, you have a new horror-comedy-thriller for me?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes sir, I do. It’s a movie called *The Menu*.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, a foodie movie. Is it about a lovable rat who helps a clumsy man become a great chef in Paris?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It is very much not that, sir. This is about a group of ultra-wealthy people who travel to a remote private island to eat at a super exclusive restaurant run by a celebrity chef named Julian Slowik.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A remote island, huh? I bet getting a reservation is a real nightmare.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It is! And among the guests are a hardcore foodie fanboy named Tyler and his date, Margot, who is not impressed by any of it.

**PRODUCER GUY:** And what's her deal?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** She’s just a normal person who thinks spending thousands of dollars on conceptual food is ridiculous.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, so she’s the audience. Got it.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly. So they get to the island and the restaurant staff is all part of this weird cult that worships the chef. The Chef gives these long, terrifying monologues before each course. For example, there's the "Breadless Bread Plate."

**PRODUCER GUY:** A breadless bread plate? Let me guess what's on that.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Just some dipping sauces, sir. No bread. It's a statement.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A statement that they are not getting bread. That's a bold choice.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It is. Then for another course, the Chef’s sous-chef stands in front of everyone and shoots himself.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh my god!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah, everyone is horrified. But Tyler, the foodie guy, thinks it's all brilliant performance art.

**PRODUCER GUY:** This Tyler fellow sounds like he has a very punchable face.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He does. Then the Chef calmly announces that everyone in the restaurant—the staff, the guests, and himself—will be dead by the end of the night.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Whoa, why?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Because the wealthy patrons have corrupted his art and taken all the love out of cooking. So this is his final masterpiece: a menu where everyone dies.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A fine-dining death cult is tight!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It is! So a rich guy tries to escape.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Is it difficult for him to get away?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Actually, it’s going to be super easy, barely an inconvenience.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, really?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, sir. They catch him instantly and chop off his ring finger.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wow wow wow. So escaping isn't really on the menu, I guess.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It is not. So the Chef realizes Margot doesn't belong. He finds out she's an escort that Tyler hired after his girlfriend broke up with him, so she wasn't on the original guest list. The Chef tells her she must choose: is she with the staff or the customers? The givers or the takers?

**PRODUCER GUY:** That's a deep question for the middle of dinner.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It is. So, since Tyler knew everyone was going to die and brought her anyway, the Chef decides to humiliate him. He makes Tyler cook a dish, calls it disgusting, and then whispers in his ear to go hang himself.

**PRODUCER GUY:** And he does it?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He sure does.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Man, food critics are harsh.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So Margot decides she's had enough of this. She stands up, tells the Chef his food is made without love, and that she's still hungry.

**PRODUCER GUY:** What's she going to do? Complain to the manager?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** She orders a cheeseburger.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A cheeseburger? Her master plan to survive this whole ordeal is to order America's favorite sandwich?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Pretty much! And it works! The Chef gets genuinely excited because making a simple, good burger reminds him of why he started cooking in the first place. He lovingly prepares her the best cheeseburger in the world.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So getting out of there is going to be pretty hard for her, I imagine.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Actually, it's going to be super easy, barely an inconvenience.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, really?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah. She takes one perfect bite, says it's delicious, and asks for the rest to-go. The Chef is so pleased that someone finally just enjoyed his food that he packs it up and lets her leave.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So she’s the only one who survives because she craved some good old-fashioned junk food?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** That's right. And for the final dessert course, the Chef covers all the remaining guests in marshmallow hats and melted chocolate and sets the entire restaurant on fire.

**PRODUCER GUY:** They're s'mores! He turned them all into human s'mores! Human s'mores are TIGHT!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yep. The movie ends with Margot sailing away on a boat, eating her cheeseburger, and watching the whole place burn down.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wow. A horror movie that satirizes pretentious foodie culture is a weirdly specific pitch. But it sounds sharp, dark, and utterly insane. People are going to eat this up.
