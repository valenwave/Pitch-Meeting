**PRODUCER GUY**: So you got a new idea for me?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**: Yes, sir, I do! So picture this: A spin-off of the *John Wick* universe.

**PRODUCER GUY**: Oh, really? So it's gonna be about John Wick again? Because those movies make a lot of money.

**SCREENWRITER GUY**: Well, no, sir. It's about a new character. Her name is Ballerina. She's also an assassin.

**PRODUCER GUY**: Ballerina? Is she, like, a dancer who *also* kills people? Or a killer who *also* dances?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**: Both, actually! She's a highly trained assassin who was orphaned and raised in this secret ballet school that doubles as an assassin training ground.

**PRODUCER GUY**: Wait, so it's a ballet school, but also an assassin school? So are they, like, doing pli√©s with pistols?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**: Something like that! It's very disciplined. And she's out for revenge because her family was murdered.

**PRODUCER GUY**: Her family was murdered? Oh, that's new. I've never seen that in a movie before.

**SCREENWRITER GUY**: Right? So she goes on this quest for vengeance, and she's got all these cool fight scenes, and she's really good at what she does.

**PRODUCER GUY**: So she's just, like, killing a bunch of people. Is there a story here? Or is it just a montage of her doing pirouettes and then shooting someone?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**: Well, she's trying to find the people responsible for her family's death. And she encounters some familiar faces from the *John Wick* world.

**PRODUCER GUY**: Oh, so we're bringing in characters from the original movies? That's what people want! Are we talking about John Wick himself? Because Keanu Reeves makes a lot of money.

**SCREENWRITER GUY**: Well, he's in it, yes. And Ian McShane as Winston. And Lance Reddick, bless his soul, as Charon. It's a real treat for the fans.

**PRODUCER GUY**: Okay, okay, so she's got a motive, she's got the skills, and she's got the fan service. What's the central conflict, though? Is someone trying to stop her from dancing?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**: No, it's about her getting her revenge. And she has to navigate the assassin underworld to do it.

**PRODUCER GUY**: The assassin underworld. So, like, they have a union, or something? Is there a benefits package for assassins?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**: It's more about the rules and the codes that they live by. And she's kind of breaking them to get what she wants.

**PRODUCER GUY**: Breaking the rules? That's pretty bold for an assassin. So she's, like, a renegade ballerina?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**: You could say that! And the action is gonna be fantastic. Very brutal, very stylish.

**PRODUCER GUY**: Brutal and stylish. So, like, a dance-off, but with guns?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**: It's gonna be great, trust me. People are gonna love this.

**PRODUCER GUY**: You know what? I think you might be right. A *John Wick* spin-off with a new female lead and familiar faces? This could really resonate with audiences.
