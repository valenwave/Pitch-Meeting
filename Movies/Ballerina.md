**(SCENE START)**

**INT. PRODUCER'S OFFICE - DAY**

The PRODUCER GUY gestures expansively from behind his desk. The SCREENWRITER GUY looks a little frazzled, but determined.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, tell me about this new action flick. I hear it's got... dancing?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, yes, sir! It's called *Ballerina*! It's a spin-off from the *John Wick* universe!

**PRODUCER GUY:** *Ballerina*? As in, pirouettes and tutus? And it's in the *John Wick* universe? So, instead of a pencil, she kills people with a pointe shoe? That's super easy, barely an inconvenience.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly! Well, not *exactly* a pointe shoe. But the premise is, she's an assassin named Rooney, played by Ana de Armas, who's also a highly trained ballerina. She's seeking revenge for the murder of her family.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Right, because in the *John Wick* universe, everyone's family gets murdered. It's like a prerequisite for being a skilled killer. So, she's got the ballet training, which I assume makes her, like, super flexible and agile for fighting?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Precisely! Her movements are graceful and fluid, but also incredibly lethal. It's a dance of death!

**PRODUCER GUY:** A dance of death. So, she's going to be doing grand jetés while shooting bad guys? And maybe a plié before a headshot?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** You're getting it! We see her training in a secret assassins' ballet school, run by the Director, played by Anjelica Huston!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, the stern, no-nonsense ballet mistress from *John Wick: Chapter 3*. So, she's basically running a finishing school for highly lethal, emotionally damaged dancers. Makes perfect sense.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** And this time, we delve deeper into the lore of that world. How they train, their strict code...

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, more rules for the assassins? Because what everyone really wants from an action movie is more paperwork.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** But it adds to the mystique! And of course, John Wick himself makes an appearance!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Keanu's in it? So, he's just going to show up, say two lines, and then disappear?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** More like, he provides some sage advice. He's like the wise elder statesman of the assassin world.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Right, because he's practically ancient now, with all the sequels he's been in. So, what's her motivation for revenge? Was it, like, a really bad ballet review?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, her entire family was wiped out in a bombing. She believes the perpetrator is a powerful figure in the criminal underworld.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, she's going to systematically eliminate everyone involved, like a very violent, ballet-themed spreadsheet.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** With incredible action sequences! We've got car chases, hand-to-hand combat in incredibly confined spaces, and a whole lot of creative kills!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Creative kills? Like, she uses a feather from her costume to, like, stab someone through the eye?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** (Hesitates) Uh, not quite. More like using environmental elements, and of course, her unique skillset. Think a combination of elegance and brutal efficiency.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, it's pretty much a *John Wick* movie, but with more emphasis on, like, leg extensions?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** And a female lead! It's empowering! She's strong, she's vulnerable, she's seeking justice!

**PRODUCER GUY:** She's vulnerable? So, she'll probably get shot a few times, but then just, like, *ballet* her way out of it?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** She perseveres! It's all about pushing through pain for the ultimate goal. Just like a real ballerina!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Super. And what about the ending? Does she get her revenge and then finally, like, retire to a quiet life of teaching dance?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, she gets her revenge, but the ending leaves it open for her to continue her journey. It's a big universe, sir. There are always more bad guys.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Of course there are. Because if there weren't, then what would all the other assassins do? Get jobs at Starbucks? Alright, *Ballerina*. Sounds like it's going to have a lot of... *points* of interest.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** (Nods enthusiastically) It does, sir!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Good. Just make sure we have enough slow-motion shots of her, you know, gracefully dodging bullets. People love that.
