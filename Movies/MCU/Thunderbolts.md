**(SCENE START)**

**INT. PRODUCER'S OFFICE - DAY**

The PRODUCER GUY sits behind his large, gleaming desk. The SCREENWRITER GUY sits opposite him, nervously clutching a stack of papers.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, you've got a new Marvel movie for me, huh? What's the title?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It's called *Thunderbolts***!**

**PRODUCER GUY:** *Thunderbolts***?** With an asterisk? What's the asterisk for?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Oh, you know, just... to make it look cool. It's like a brand, you know? Like "Target*" or "Toys R Us*".

**PRODUCER GUY:** Right. Because when I think "Toys R Us", I think "gritty, anti-hero team-up". Makes total sense. So, who are these "Thunderbolts" anyway? Are they like... dark Avengers?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly! They're a team of morally ambiguous characters, mostly villains or anti-heroes from previous movies.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, not exactly the heroes we've been rooting for, then. Super easy, barely an inconvenience.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, no, that's the point! They're forced to work for the government under the leadership of Valentina Allegra de Fontaine.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Ah, Valentina. The lady who keeps popping up in post-credits scenes like she's looking for her car keys.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** She's assembling this team for... special missions. Things the Avengers wouldn't touch.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Like what? Stealing office supplies? Getting a discount at the buffet?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** More like, you know, covert ops, black ops, highly dangerous... ops.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, they're like the MCU's Suicide Squad?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes! But, you know, *good*!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, so it's a "they're bad guys but they do good things, kinda" movie?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Precisely! We've got Yelena Belova, the Winter Soldier, US Agent...

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wait, so Bucky Barnes is on this team? The Winter Soldier? The guy who was brainwashed into being a super assassin for like 70 years? He's a "Thunderbolt" now?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, he's trying to do good now! He's on his redemption arc.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Right, right. Because nothing says "redemption" like joining a government-sponsored black ops team.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** And then there's US Agent, who's basically Captain America if Captain America was really, really angry all the time and had impulse control issues.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, a Captain America who shouts at the cashier if they get his order wrong? Got it. And who's the big bad they're fighting?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It's... it's a surprise!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, a *surprise* villain. Because those have always gone over well in the MCU. I'm sure it'll be super satisfying when we finally figure out who it is. Probably some guy we've never heard of before.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, the focus is really on the team dynamics! They're all these broken individuals, and they have to learn to trust each other, even though they're all kind of jerks.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, it's a team of jerks learning to be slightly less jerky jerks? Riveting. And there's going to be lots of action, I assume? Explosions? Slow-motion fighting?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Oh, tons! Lots of cool stunts, high-octane chases, and some really brutal hand-to-hand combat.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Great! Because nothing gets butts in seats like watching a bunch of people we barely care about punching each other for two hours.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** But they'll *learn* to care about them! Through shared trauma! And witty banter!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Witty banter, you say? So, lots of sarcastic one-liners?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So many! It'll be like a symphony of snark.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Perfect. As long as there's plenty of "I'm the worst but I'm doing my best" moments, I think we've got a hit. And what about the ending? Do they, like, save the world? Or just cause more problems?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, they complete their mission, but it raises a lot of questions about who they can really trust, and what it truly means to be a hero.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Ah, "raises questions." The classic MCU ending. So, it's like we're setting up for another three movies?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, we are in a cinematic *universe*, sir. We can't just end things! That would be... inconvenient.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Right, right. So, *Thunderbolts***. Sounds like a realâ€¦ asterisk of a movie.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** (Beaming) It sure is, sir!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Super. Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to go figure out what's up with that asterisk. I'm pretty sure it means I owe someone money.
