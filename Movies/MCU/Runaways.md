**Producer Guy:** Okay, so we've done the dark, gritty street-level heroes. What's next for our Marvel slate? Something lighter, perhaps? Maybe... teenagers?

**Screenwriter Guy:** We've got *Runaways*! It's about a group of teenagers who discover their parents are supervillains!

**Producer Guy:** Wait, what? Their *parents* are the bad guys? Not some shadowy organization or a dude in a weird suit? Their actual mom and dad are, like, building death rays in the garage?

**Screenwriter Guy:** Exactly! They're called The Pride. They meet once a year for this mysterious ritual, and the kids accidentally stumble upon them... sacrificing someone.

**Producer Guy:** Sacrificing someone?! Their parents are, like, actual cultists? Oh, that's dark. Like, *really* dark for a show about teenagers. So, these kids, they just, like, call the police? Or they run away? Hence the title?

**Screenwriter Guy:** They run away! They're from different cliques at school â€“ the popular girl, the smart one, the activist, the jock, the goth, and the weird one with the dinosaur.

**Producer Guy:** Wait, a dinosaur? One of the parents has a pet dinosaur? Is it, like, a cute little raptor, or a giant T-Rex that just, like, sits on the couch and watches TV?

**Screenwriter Guy:** It's a Deinonychus! Her name is Old Lace, and she has a telepathic bond with one of the kids, Gertrude. She's a genetically engineered dinosaur, a gift from her parents.

**Producer Guy:** A genetically engineered dinosaur that bonds telepathically with a teenager. And their parents are sacrificing people. This is... a lot. So, these kids, what are their powers? Do they get powers from their evil parents?

**Screenwriter Guy:** Some of them do! One has a magical staff, another has super strength, one can manipulate light, one can control the dinosaur, and two are just super smart and inventive. They use their parents' tech against them.

**Producer Guy:** So, they're like a dysfunctional Avengers team, but they're all high schoolers, and their nemesis is their PTA meeting. Do they wear, like, cool costumes? Or just, like, regular teen clothes while trying to fight their evil parents?

**Screenwriter Guy:** Just regular teen clothes, mostly. They're not, like, "superheroes" in the traditional sense. They're just kids trying to figure out who they are, while also trying to stop their parents from, you know, destroying the world.

**Producer Guy:** Destroying the world? So, The Pride isn't just a quaint little sacrificing club? They've got, like, a bigger plan? A global domination scheme, perhaps?

**Screenwriter Guy:** They're trying to bring about a new world order, yes. It's all tied to a larger, ancient alien prophecy.

**Producer Guy:** Aliens! Of course! So, the parents are cultists *and* alien conspirators. Got it. What's the central drama here? Is it, like, awkward family dinners where they subtly try to figure out if Dad's been experimenting on the cat?

**Screenwriter Guy:** The drama is in the trust issues. They have to rely on each other because they literally can't trust anyone else, especially their parents. And they're still teenagers, so there's all the usual teen angst and romance, too.

**Producer Guy:** Teen angst and romance, with a side of ritualistic sacrifice and a telepathic dinosaur. This is certainly a unique blend. Does anyone, like, bring a packed lunch to their evil parent showdowns?

**Screenwriter Guy:** Probably! They're still kids, after all. They're resourceful. They build their own hideout. They're basically a super-powered, fugitive family.

**Producer Guy:** A fugitive family with a dinosaur. I'm seeing the merchandise already. So, it's a coming-of-age story, a sci-fi thriller, and a family drama all rolled into one. And the parents are genuinely evil? They're not, like, misunderstood?

**Screenwriter Guy:** Well, they believe they're doing it for a greater good. But the methods are definitely evil. And the kids have to grapple with the fact that their parents are monsters.

**Producer Guy:** Right, right. So, it's like finding out your parents are really into, like, extreme couponing, but instead of saving money, they're sacrificing people. Okay, I'm intrigued. Just make sure the dinosaur gets plenty of screen time. That's good TV. And maybe one of the parents accidentally sacrifices, like, a really expensive lawn gnome instead of a person. For comedic effect.

**Screenwriter Guy:** I'll... consider it.
