**Producer Guy:** Alright, so we've done the dark, gritty, street-level stuff, the mystical kung-fu, the bulletproof hero, and even the super-powered teen drama. What's next for our expanding MCU on Disney+? Is it, like, a heartwarming tale of a superhero adopting a puppy?

**Screenwriter Guy:** We've got *Secret Invasion*! It's a huge, global conspiracy thriller starring Nick Fury.

**Producer Guy:** Nick Fury, huh? The guy with the eye patch? So, he's back. Last time I saw him, he was, like, chilling on a space station or something. What's the pitch? Is he, like, looking for a lost sock?

**Screenwriter Guy:** No, no. He's back on Earth, and it's bad. The Skrulls, those shapeshifting aliens from *Captain Marvel*? They've been secretly infiltrating Earth for decades. And now, they're making their move.

**Producer Guy:** Wait, the nice Skrulls? The refugees? The ones we were supposed to feel bad for? *They're* the bad guys now? So, all that "we're just looking for a home" stuff was just, like, a big lie?

**Screenwriter Guy:** Not all of them! Some are still good. But a radical faction, led by Gravik, has grown impatient. They're tired of waiting for Fury to find them a new home, so they're taking Earth for themselves.

**Producer Guy:** So, it's a "who can you trust?" kind of show. Anyone could be a Skrull! My mailman could be a Skrull! My therapist could be a Skrull, and that would actually explain a lot. How do we even know *Nick Fury* isn't a Skrull?

**Screenwriter Guy:** Exactly! That's the tension. Nick Fury is on his own. He's a bit rusty, a bit disillusioned. And he's gotta figure out who the real players are, and who's just wearing a Skrull mask. Even his old allies, like Maria Hill and James Rhodes, might not be who they seem.

**Producer Guy:** Oh, Rhodes is in it? So, War Machine might be a Skrull? Man, that's gonna cause some headaches for Sam Wilson. So, what's the big Skrull plan? Are they, like, planning to turn everyone into green, wrinkly versions of themselves?

**Screenwriter Guy:** They're inciting conflicts between nations, escalating tensions, trying to destabilize the world so they can just walk in and take over. They're planting themselves in positions of power.

**Producer Guy:** So, it's like a spy thriller, but instead of Cold War spies, it's green aliens who can look like anyone. Is there, like, a secret handshake to tell who's a Skrull and who's not? Or does Fury just, like, randomly punch people in the face to see if they turn green?

**Screenwriter Guy:** Fury has to rely on his wits, his network of spies, and a few key allies, like the Skrull Talos, who's still on their side. And G'iah, Talos's daughter, who gets some... interesting upgrades.

**Producer Guy:** "Interesting upgrades." Does she, like, get a super-Skrull form? Because that would be cool. And what about Samuel L. Jackson? Is he bringing that classic, gravelly Fury voice?

**Screenwriter Guy:** Absolutely! It's a darker, more vulnerable Nick Fury than we've seen before. He's facing his past failures and the consequences of his actions. He's out of his depth, in a way.

**Producer Guy:** Out of his depth? Nick Fury? The guy who basically runs the world's spy network? That's a bold choice. So, no giant CGI battles in space? Just, like, tense conversations in shadowy rooms?

**Screenwriter Guy:** Mostly. It's a character-driven thriller. Think *Captain America: The Winter Soldier*, but with more shapeshifting and a much higher stakes global conspiracy.

**Producer Guy:** Global conspiracy with shapeshifters. And Nick Fury's, like, having a mid-life crisis. I like it. But does he, at any point, accidentally reveal a Skrull by offering them, like, a really spicy pickle, and the Skrull can't handle it? That's good character work.

**Screenwriter Guy:** I... don't think a pickle plays a major role in the Skrull reveal. But it's a tight, intense story.

**Producer Guy:** Alright, alright. Just make sure there's at least one scene where he takes off the eye patch to reveal... something surprising. That's good TV.

**Screenwriter Guy:** We can definitely do that.
