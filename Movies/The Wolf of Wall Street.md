**PRODUCER GUY:** So you have a movie for me?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes sir, I do. It’s a three-hour epic about finance, drugs, and greed, directed by Martin Scorsese.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, so it’s going to be super long, have a ton of narration, and probably win a bunch of awards that aren’t Best Picture or Best Director?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** That’s the formula! So our hero is this guy Jordan Belfort, and he gets a job on Wall Street where his mentor, played by a chest-thumping Matthew McConaughey, tells him the keys to success are cocaine and self-pleasure.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Sounds like a healthy work environment.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It is! But then the market crashes on his first day.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh no! So I assume his promising career is over before it even began?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Actually, it’s going to be super easy, barely an inconvenience.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, really?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah, he immediately starts his own firm in a sketchy garage with a bunch of his burnout friends, selling worthless penny stocks to working-class people.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Defrauding the poor is tight!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It is! And he becomes incredibly rich. So rich that he and his new best friend Donnie start doing just an unbelievable amount of drugs.

**PRODUCER GUY:** How many drugs are we talking about?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** We’re talking about "sneaking cocaine over the border" drugs, "throwing office parties with prostitutes and a marching band" drugs, and "let's take these 15-year-old Quaaludes" drugs.

**PRODUCER GUY:** That last one sounds specific and dangerous.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It is! So the Quaaludes have a delayed reaction, and Jordan finds himself completely paralyzed at a country club, needing to get home to stop Donnie from talking on a wiretapped phone.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So he’s trapped? How will he get to a car and drive?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He’s going to slowly, painfully, and hilariously roll down a flight of stairs and then crawl inch by inch to his Lamborghini.

**PRODUCER GUY:** And then I assume someone helps him?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Nope, he opens the door with his foot and drives home, smashing into everything along the way but arriving without a scratch on himself.

**PRODUCER GUY:** The human body is truly a miracle. So does the FBI, who are investigating him, ever catch on?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** They do! This agent named Patrick Denham is closing in, so Jordan tries to hide his money in a Swiss bank.

**PRODUCER GUY:** How does one do that?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** By taping millions of dollars in cash to a bunch of people and having them fly to Switzerland, of course.

**PRODUCER GUY:** That seems like a flawless and not-at-all-suspicious plan.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It isn't! And things get worse. His giant yacht sinks in a storm, the Swiss banker gets arrested, and the FBI finally corners him.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So he’s going to jail for a very long time. The consequences of his actions have finally caught up with him.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, he agrees to wear a wire to rat out all his friends for a shorter sentence.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A classic anti-hero move.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** But then, while wearing the wire, he secretly passes a note to Donnie telling him not to incriminate himself.

**PRODUCER GUY:** But… he’s wearing a wire. The FBI is listening to that exact conversation. Why would he do that?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So we can have a tense scene, sir! Anyway, he gets caught, but still only gets 36 months in a minimum-security prison that’s basically a tennis camp.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wow, the justice system is famously lenient on wealthy financial criminals.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It is! And when he gets out, he becomes a motivational speaker, teaching other people his sales techniques.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So what’s the lesson here? That crime pays off handsomely?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** The lesson is that it’s a really fun movie! What do you think?

**PRODUCER GUY:** A three-hour movie that glorifies a bunch of awful, drug-addled criminals doing despicable things sounds like a tough sell. But with Scorsese and DiCaprio, people will probably call it a masterpiece for some reason. Let’s make it.
