**PRODUCER GUY:** So, what do you got for me?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Okay, so it’s about a guy who creates a website.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A website? You mean like... GeoCities? Is it about GeoCities? Because I remember those sparkly GIFs, man. They were *next level*.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, no. Not GeoCities. This is… a social networking website. For connecting people.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, like MySpace? We gotta get Tom involved! He’s everybody’s first friend! That’s, like, his whole thing!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Not MySpace. This is… *the* social network. It's called Facebook.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Face… book? So it’s like a book, but with faces in it? Like a yearbook, but… digital? Is it a picture book? Is it for kids? Because, you know, we really need to crack that toddler market. They’re super into screens now.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, it’s for college students. And it’s about how this guy, Mark Zuckerberg, created it, and all the legal drama that happened because of it.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Legal drama? For a website? Is he, like, pirating movies on it? Because that's a *real* problem, man. The Internet is full of pirates. They should just make all the movies available for free! Then nobody would pirate them! It's a simple solution!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, it's about him supposedly stealing the idea from these twins, the Winklevosses, and also screwing over his best friend, Eduardo Saverin, on the business side.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wait, so our main character is… kind of an unlikeable jerk? That’s usually not a selling point, man. People like heroes. Like, Superman. He flies around, he’s super strong, he never gets sued.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He's a genius, but socially awkward. And the story is told through these deposition scenes, where he's being sued by both parties.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So it's a courtroom drama… but about code? Is there, like, a dramatic montage of him typing really fast? Because that’s visually stunning, man. We could, like, add some cool sound effects. *Click-clack-whoosh!*

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** There's a scene where he creates "Facemash" which lets people rate college girls. That gets him into trouble.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oooh, *controversy!* I like it! We can market it as edgy! "See the website that broke the internet… and a lot of hearts!"

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** And then Sean Parker, from Napster, gets involved.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Napster! See! I knew there was piracy in here somewhere! Is he going to show him how to illegally download music on Facebook? Because then it’s a crossover event! We can call it "The Social Pirate Network!"

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, Parker convinces Zuckerberg to drop "The" from "TheFacebook" and just call it "Facebook." And he gets him to move to California.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wait, so the big dramatic moment is… removing "The"? That’s not exactly "Luke, I am your father," man. That’s more like "Luke, I’m changing your address to California."

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It's about the birth of a global phenomenon. And the betrayal of friendship. And the lonely pursuit of success.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Okay, okay, I'm getting it. It's like *Citizen Kane*, but instead of "Rosebud," it's "friend request pending." I think it's got potential, man. People love stories about rich guys who don't have any friends. It makes them feel better about their own lives. We can totally market this.
