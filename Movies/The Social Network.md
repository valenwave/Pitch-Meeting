**PRODUCER GUY:** So, you have a movie for me about a website?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes sir, I do. It’s about the founding of Facebook.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Facebook? The thing my aunt uses to post pictures of her cats and complain about the government? Sounds thrilling.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, it's more about the drama and betrayal behind the scenes. So, we start with our main character, Mark Zuckerberg, a Harvard student, who gets dumped by his girlfriend.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Ah, a classic tale of heartbreak. Does he write a sad song on an acoustic guitar?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, he gets drunk, goes back to his dorm, and writes a nasty blog post about her. Then, he creates a website called Facemash where students can rate the attractiveness of female students.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wow. So our hero is kind of a jerk.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly! This gets him in trouble with Harvard but also gets him noticed by the Winklevoss twins. They're handsome, rich, and row crew.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, they’re the opposite of our main character. Got it.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** They have an idea for a Harvard-exclusive social network and want Mark to code it for them. Mark agrees, but then he gets a better idea. He goes to his friend, Eduardo Saverin, for a thousand dollars to start his own site called "TheFacebook."

**PRODUCER GUY:** So he just steals their idea?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He "improves" upon it. TheFacebook becomes a huge hit, and the Winklevoss twins are not happy. They complain to the president of Harvard, who basically tells them to get lost.

**PRODUCER GUY:** An adult who doesn't see the potential of the internet? Shocking.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Then, Napster co-founder Sean Parker gets involved. He tells Mark to drop the "The" from TheFacebook. Just "Facebook."

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wow, what a visionary. That's a billion-dollar idea right there.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It is! Parker convinces Mark to move to California, leaving Eduardo in New York to handle the business side of things. But then, Eduardo gets mad that Parker is making business decisions and freezes the company's bank account.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, a financial squabble. My favorite kind of drama.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So Mark, feeling betrayed, has the new investment deal structured to dilute Eduardo’s shares from 34% to 0.03%.

**PRODUCER GUY:** That seems... harsh.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It is! Eduardo finds out and vows to sue him. This all plays out through depositions for two lawsuits: one from the Winklevoss twins for stealing their idea, and one from Eduardo for getting screwed over.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So it's a legal drama now? What happened to the fun college stuff?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** That's all in flashbacks! The movie jumps between the depositions and the past, showing how it all went down.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, who wins in the end?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, a junior lawyer on Mark's team tells him he’ll settle with Eduardo because Mark’s attitude will make him look bad to a jury. And in the final scene, Mark, now a billionaire, is all alone and sends a friend request to the girl who dumped him at the beginning. He just keeps refreshing the page, waiting for her to accept.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wow. So he has all the money and success in the world, but he's still just that lonely kid from the beginning. That's deep. It sounds like a movie that will make people think about friendship, ambition, and what it means to be connected in the modern world. It will probably win a bunch of awards.
