**INT. PIXAR CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY**

PRODUCER GUY sips from a very expensive-looking coffee mug. SCREENWRITER GUY nervously adjusts his glasses.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So, for *Inside Out 2*, we're going to dive back into Riley's head!

**PRODUCER GUY:** (Eyes widening) Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on. We did that already. Didn't we tie that up with a neat little bow? Joy and Sadness learned to get along, Riley was happy. Bing Bong died, which was… (shudders) …a lot.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Right! But now, Riley's a teenager!

**PRODUCER GUY:** (Raises an eyebrow) Oh, so… more emotions? That's your big idea? We just add more guys in the control room?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly! See, when you hit puberty, it's not just Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Disgust anymore. You get… new emotions! Like Anxiety!

**PRODUCER GUY:** (Nods slowly) Anxiety. Okay, I can see that. That's relatable. Everyone has anxiety. Especially when they're pitching a sequel. Just saying.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** And Ennui!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Ennui? Like, boredom? So we're going to have an emotion that just… sighs and looks at its phone? Sounds thrilling for a two-hour movie.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It's *teenage* ennui! It's different! It's… *profound*. And Embarrassment! He's a big, shy guy who blushes!

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, a giant, pink, socially awkward blob? This is getting crowded in there, don't you think? Headquarters must be like a clown car.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** And Envy!

**PRODUCER GUY:** (Pinches the bridge of his nose) Envy. Right. So we're just rolling out the whole emotional thesaurus now? What's next, Regret? Apathy? The overwhelming urge to scroll TikTok for four hours straight?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, we have some ideas for future installments… But the core conflict this time is that these new emotions, especially Anxiety, kind of… kick the old emotions out of Headquarters.

**PRODUCER GUY:** (Sits up, intrigued) Ooh, a hostile takeover! I like it! So Joy and the gang are out on the streets? Or… in the back of Riley's mind, which is basically the same thing.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly! They have to journey back to Headquarters to regain control, while Riley tries to navigate high school tryouts and new friends with only her new, chaotic emotions running the show.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, like an emotional road trip. With a lot more... teen angst. Is there a character like Bing Bong? Someone we can kill off to make everyone cry? Because that worked *really* well last time. Just devastating.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** We… don't have a direct equivalent to Bing Bong. But the emotional journey is very poignant, especially with Anxiety trying to do what's best for Riley, even if it's misguided. It's about accepting all parts of yourself!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Accepting all parts of yourself, eh? So, a message movie? But with colorful animated blobs. So it’s *art*… that makes money.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It’s a very relatable story for anyone who's been a teenager, or is raising one! The reviews have been really strong! And it's already made over a billion dollars worldwide!

**PRODUCER GUY:** (Sputters, nearly spilling his coffee) A BILLION?! So, not only is it relatable and poignant, it's also a cash cow?! Why didn't you lead with that, pal?! Forget the existential ennui, let's talk about the *money*!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, I wanted to set the tone…

**PRODUCER GUY:** The tone is "billion dollars"! That's the tone I like! So, who's voice acting the new emotions? Is it, like, all the TikTok stars? Because that’s where the money is now, apparently.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** We have Maya Hawke as Anxiety, and she's fantastic! Adèle Exarchopoulos as Ennui, Paul Walter Hauser as Embarrassment, and Ayo Edebiri as Envy!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, the *talent*! You really went all out for this billion-dollar sequel! Alright, alright, I'm in! Now, about that *Inside Out 3*… I'm thinking… mid-life crisis emotions. Stress, Regret, the overwhelming urge to buy a convertible… just spitballing here. Make it happen, pal! And make it a *billion-dollar* spitball.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** (Sighs, but a hopeful sigh) I'll get right on it.
