**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Sir, I have a new movie idea for me, and this one is… a lot.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh boy. Is it another multiverse movie? I feel like we’re doing a lot of those lately.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, yes. But hear me out. It's called "Everything Everywhere All At Once."

**PRODUCER GUY:** That title is also a lot.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It is! So, our main character is this woman named Evelyn Wang. She runs a struggling laundromat, her husband Waymond wants a divorce, her daughter Joy is gay and Evelyn can’t quite accept it, and her very critical father just showed up to be disappointed in her some more. Oh, and also she’s being audited by the IRS.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wow, so her life is just a series of unfortunate events. Sounds like a real feel-good movie.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So she’s at the IRS building with her whole family, and suddenly her husband's body gets taken over by a version of himself from another universe called the "Alpha-verse."

**PRODUCER GUY:** An Alpha-Waymond, you say? So he’s cool now?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Very cool! And he knows martial arts! He tells Evelyn she’s the only one who can save the multiverse from a powerful being named Jobu Tupaki.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Jobu Tupaki? Is that a person or a menu item?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It’s a person! And get this, Jobu Tupaki is actually the Alpha-verse version of her daughter, Joy. See, Alpha-Evelyn pushed her daughter so hard to verse-jump that her mind shattered, and now she experiences every universe at once and has concluded that nothing matters.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So the villain is a nihilistic teenager with god-like powers? That’s both terrifying and deeply relatable.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly! So to fight her, Evelyn has to learn how to "verse-jump," which lets her access the skills of her alternate-universe selves.

**PRODUCER GUY:** How does she do that? Does she have to meditate or something?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Nope! She has to do something really random and statistically unlikely. Like putting her shoes on the wrong feet, giving herself paper cuts between her fingers, or eating a tube of chapstick.

**PRODUCER GUY:** She has to eat chapstick to learn kung fu?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** She sure does! And we'll see her jump into all sorts of crazy universes. There’s one where she’s a famous movie star. There’s one where she’s a hibachi chef and her rival is secretly controlled by a raccoon under his hat.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A raccoon? Like that rat movie?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Precisely! We’ll call him Raccacoonie.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Making a joke based on another beloved animated film is tight!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** And then there's a universe where everyone has hot dogs for fingers.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Excuse me, they have what now?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Hot dogs for fingers. And in that universe, she’s in a romantic relationship with the IRS inspector, played by Jamie Lee Curtis.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So there’s a tender love story in a world where people have floppy sausage hands?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It’s actually very moving! There’s even a universe where Evelyn and Joy are just rocks with googly eyes on them.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So they’re rocks. And they just sit there?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** They do. And they have a profound, heart-to-heart conversation using only subtitles. People will cry.

**PRODUCER GUY:** You think a scene with two silent rocks is going to make people cry? This movie sounds insane.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It is! So Evelyn learns that Jobu Tupaki doesn’t want to destroy everything, she just wants to find a version of her mom who understands her. She created an actual "everything bagel" that’s a swirling black hole of despair that will suck everything into it.

**PRODUCER GUY:** An everything bagel of doom. Sounds like something I ate for breakfast this morning.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So in the climax, Evelyn realizes she has the same powers as Jobu. But instead of fighting with her fists, she’s going to fight with empathy.

**PRODUCER GUY:** She’s going to hug them into submission?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Basically! She uses her powers to understand her enemies and give them what they need, fixing their problems and neutralizing them with kindness. Meanwhile, her husband, Waymond, takes out a bunch of guards with a fanny pack.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A fanny pack fight is super easy, barely an inconvenience!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So she finally confronts Joy, who is about to step into the bagel. Evelyn tells her that even if nothing matters, and she could be anywhere else in the multiverse, she will always, always want to be here with her.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wow. So she saves the entire multiverse with the power of love.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** She sure does! And then she reconciles with her husband and finally finishes her taxes.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So let me get this straight. It’s a completely original, genre-bending sci-fi martial arts comedy about generational trauma, nihilism, and the power of kindness, with a predominantly Asian cast? It’s way too weird and thoughtful for a mainstream audience. It’ll probably bomb. But what the heck, let’s make it anyway.
