**PRODUCER GUY:** So, you got a movie for me?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes sir, I do. It’s about a middle-aged woman who runs a laundromat, is being audited by the IRS, her husband wants a divorce, and she has a strained relationship with her daughter and father.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wow, that sounds... incredibly depressing. Is it a gritty drama?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Not exactly. See, while she's in a meeting with the IRS agent, her husband’s body is taken over by a version of himself from another universe.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, a multiverse movie! Those are super in right now.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly! So, this "Alpha-Waymond" tells our hero, Evelyn, that every choice she's ever made has created a new parallel universe. And now, a powerful being named Jobu Tupaki is threatening to destroy them all.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Jobu Tupaki? Sounds like a character from a children's show. What's her deal?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, she's actually the Alpha-verse version of Evelyn’s daughter, Joy. Evelyn’s Alpha-self pushed her too hard with the verse-jumping technology, and her mind splintered. Now she experiences every universe at once and can manipulate matter at will.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So she's basically a god with generational trauma. Tight.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** And she’s created an "Everything Bagel," which is a black hole that can destroy the multiverse.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A bagel? A literal everything bagel is the ultimate weapon?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It’s a metaphor for nihilism! When you put everything on a bagel, it becomes... well, nothing.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Deep. So, why Evelyn? What makes this laundromat owner so special?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Because she's the biggest failure of all the Evelyns in the multiverse! She has the most untapped potential. To fight Jobu's minions, she has to "verse-jump" and access the skills of her alternate selves.

**PRODUCER GUY:** How does she do that?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** By performing statistically improbable actions.

**PRODUCER GUY:** What does that even mean?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Like, she has to declare her love for the IRS agent, or eat a tube of chapstick. Super easy, barely an inconvenience.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So we’re going to have a bunch of weird, random stuff happening.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Oh yeah. There’s a universe where everyone has hot dogs for fingers. And another where she's a famous martial arts movie star. And one where she's a hibachi chef who uncovers that her rival is being controlled by a racoon under his hat, like Ratatouille.

**PRODUCER GUY:** ...Raccacoonie?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** We’re workshopping the name. The point is, Evelyn starts to see all the lives she could have led. Meanwhile, Jobu Tupaki is trying to convince her that nothing matters and she should just enter the bagel with her.

**PRODUCER GUY:** It's going to be tough to escape that kind of existential dread.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Actually, it’s going to be super easy, barely an inconvenience.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, really?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah, see, Evelyn has a realization. Instead of fighting, she uses her powers to understand people’s pain and bring them happiness. She fights with empathy. And googly eyes.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Googly eyes?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Her husband puts them on everything. They represent finding joy in the meaninglessness of it all. It’s the opposite of the bagel.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, she saves the multiverse with kindness and googly eyes?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Pretty much! She reconciles with her husband, accepts her daughter for who she is, and even convinces the IRS agent to let them redo their taxes.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A multiverse-spanning, action-packed, philosophical martial arts movie that’s ultimately about family and taxes. I have no idea what to make of this. It’s either going to be a colossal failure or a massive hit.
