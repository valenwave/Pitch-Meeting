**PRODUCER GUY:** So you have a movie for me?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes sir, I do. Itâ€™s based on a theme park ride.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A movie based on a theme park ride? That sounds like a terrible idea. I love it, what have you got?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** *Pirates of the Caribbean*!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Fire away.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So the movie opens on a ship sailing through the fog. We meet a young girl named Elizabeth Swann, who finds a shipwreck and a boy named Will Turner floating in the water. He's wearing a weird gold pirate medallion.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Pirate bling is tight!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It sure is. Elizabeth takes it from him so no one thinks he's a pirate. Flash forward eight years, and we meet our hero, Captain Jack Sparrow, making a grand entrance into Port Royal.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, he must have a really impressive ship!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He does not. He's standing on the mast of a tiny boat that is actively sinking. He majestically steps off the mast right onto the dock just as the boat disappears under the waves.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So he's a bit of a bummer.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He's an icon! Anyway, Elizabeth, who is now all grown up, faints and falls off a cliff into the ocean because her corset is too tight.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A classic corset fainting.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly. The medallion she's wearing sends out a big magical pulse through the ocean.

**PRODUCER GUY:** The medallion has pirate Wi-Fi?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Sort of. Jack Sparrow jumps in to save her, but then the Commodore tries to arrest him for being a pirate. So Jack takes Elizabeth hostage and has a very wacky escape. But that night, a spooky ship called the Black Pearl attacks the town because they felt the medallion's pulse. They kidnap Elizabeth.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh no!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It gets worse! See, the pirates on the Black Pearl are cursed. They stole a chest of Aztec gold and now they're immortal skeletons in the moonlight who can't feel anything.

**PRODUCER GUY:** That sounds like a terrible curse.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It is! To break it, they have to return all the gold, and repay a blood debt from Bootstrap Bill Turner. Elizabeth told the pirates her last name was Turner, so they think she's his kid.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wow wow wow... wow. That was a terrible decision.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So Will Turner, who is actually Bootstrap Bill's son, gets Jack Sparrow to help him rescue Elizabeth. Jack agrees because the captain of the Black Pearl, Barbossa, was his first mate who led a mutiny and stole the ship from him.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A pirate with a tragic backstory.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** You know it. So they need a ship, and they decide to steal one from the Royal Navy.

**PRODUCER GUY:** How are two guys going to steal a whole Navy vessel?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Actually, it's going to be super easy, barely an inconvenience.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, really?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah, see, Jack tricks all the sailors into guarding one huge ship, the *Dauntless*, while he and Will just walk onto the other, faster ship, the *Interceptor*, which is now completely empty.

**PRODUCER GUY:** The Royal Navy is apparently staffed by morons.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** The dumbest. So they get a crew, find the pirates, and Will rescues Elizabeth. But then Jack gets captured and Barbossa maroons both Jack and Elizabeth on a deserted island.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh no, they're doomed!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Nope! Elizabeth sets a giant pile of smuggled rum on fire, and the Navy, who just happens to be passing by, rescues them. So Jack makes a deal to lead the Navy to the pirates.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A classic double-cross.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It's a triple-cross! Jack tells Barbossa to ambush the Navy, but while he's distracting him, Jack secretly palms a piece of the cursed Aztec gold for himself.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Why would he do that?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So he can be an immortal skeleton too! It leads to a big sword fight where both Jack and Barbossa are immortal and just stabbing each other for fun.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Pointless stabbing is great!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So then Will, who has the last piece of gold, cuts his hand to repay the blood debt, breaking the curse on everyone. Jack then shoots the now-mortal Barbossa with a pistol he's been saving for ten years.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Ten years? That's some serious patience.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He's a patient pirate! So they all go back to Port Royal, Jack is sentenced to hang, but Will saves him at the last second. Jack does a cool dive into the water, his crew picks him up on the Black Pearl, and the Commodore just lets him go because it was "good business."

**PRODUCER GUY:** It was good business to let a known criminal escape?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Apparently! And Will gets the girl. So, what do you think?

**PRODUCER GUY:** An eccentric drunk pirate, skeleton ghosts, a magic medallion... it sounds ridiculous. But that main character seems fun. People might like him.
