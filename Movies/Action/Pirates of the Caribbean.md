**PRODUCER GUY:** So you have a movie for me?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes sir, I do. It’s about a theme park, but with a fun twist.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, I like fun twists. What is it?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** The attractions are dinosaurs. Real, live dinosaurs.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh. So, you’re telling me some rich guy decided it was a good idea to bring back giant prehistoric predators for entertainment?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly! His name is John Hammond, and he’s spared no expense. He’s got scientists who extracted dinosaur DNA from mosquitos trapped in amber.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Mosquitos in amber? How do they even know they’ll get dinosaur DNA and not, like, ancient tree frog DNA?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Super easy, barely an inconvenience. They just know. And to fill in the gaps in the DNA sequence, they use frog DNA.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Frog DNA. Okay. I’m sure that won’t have any unforeseen consequences whatsoever. So, who are our main characters?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** We’ve got Dr. Alan Grant, a paleontologist who hates kids, and his paleobotanist partner, Dr. Ellie Sattler. We’ve also got a chaotician named Ian Malcolm.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A chaotician? What does he do?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He mostly just points out that this whole idea is terrible and is going to end in disaster, all while wearing a cool leather jacket. He’s the voice of the audience, really.

**PRODUCER GUY:** I like him already.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So Hammond brings them all to the island to get their endorsement. He also brings his two grandchildren, Lex and Tim, because what’s a dangerous prehistoric theme park without children running around?

**PRODUCER GUY:** It’s just not the same, is it? So, I’m guessing things go horribly wrong.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Oh, you bet they do. There’s a disgruntled computer programmer, Dennis Nedry, who’s a bit of a slob. He gets paid to steal dinosaur embryos.

**PRODUCER GUY:** And to do that, he has to shut down the park’s security systems?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** The entire park’s security system, including the very important electric fences for the dinosaur paddocks. He does this during a tropical storm, by the way.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Of course he does. Let me guess, the T-Rex gets out.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** The T-Rex gets out and it is awesome! It attacks the tour vehicles, eats a lawyer who was hiding in a bathroom, and injures Ian Malcolm. It’s a whole thing.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Eating a lawyer sounds like a real crowd-pleaser. So what happens to our hero, the slobby computer guy?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He gets lost in the storm, crashes his jeep, and gets eaten by a Dilophosaurus that spits venom in his face.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wow. That’s a rough way to go. So now everyone’s scattered and being hunted by dinosaurs?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Pretty much. Dr. Grant has to protect the kids, even though he doesn’t like them. They have to climb down a giant tree and evade the T-Rex again when it starts chasing a herd of Gallimimus.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Okay, sounds exciting. What about the other dinosaurs? I feel like we’re missing some.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Oh, I was getting to the best part. The Velociraptors. They’re super smart and can open doors.

**PRODUCER GUY:** They can open doors?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** They’re problem-solvers. So while everyone’s trying to get the power back on, the raptors get out and start hunting everyone in the visitor center. There’s a super intense scene in a kitchen with the kids.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A kitchen fight with raptors. I love it. How do they escape that?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** The kids manage to lock one in a freezer. It’s very clever. Then they all meet up and try to get to the control room.

**PRODUCER GUY:** And I’m guessing the raptors are hot on their heels.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** You know it. They’re cornered in the main lobby, about to become raptor chow.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Well, it’s going to be tough to escape that.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Actually, it’s going to be super easy, barely an inconvenience.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, really?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah, because right at that moment, the T-Rex bursts in and kills the raptors, saving everyone!

**PRODUCER GUY:** The T-Rex is the hero now? The same one that was trying to eat them this whole time?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** The enemy of my enemy is my friend who is also a giant, terrifying dinosaur. It gives them enough time to escape to the helicopter and get off the island.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wow. Just wow. Dinosaurs, corporate espionage, and a T-Rex hero. This has everything. I think people are going to absolutely love this. It's a guaranteed hit.
