**PRODUCER GUY:** So you have a movie for me?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes sir, I do. It’s about a guy who can travel back in time to fix his traumatic childhood.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, so it’s a feel-good movie.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Not exactly. See, every time he goes back to change something, he messes everything up in a new and horrible way.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Making things progressively worse is tight!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So, our main character is Evan, played by Ashton Kutcher. He has these blackouts during all the super traumatic moments of his childhood.

**PRODUCER GUY:** That seems convenient for the plot.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It is! So, as an adult, he discovers that by reading his old journals, he can go back to those blackout moments and relive them. His adult mind in his kid body.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A grown man’s brain in a child’s body? I see no potential for weirdness there at all.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So, his childhood friend and love interest, Kayleigh, has had a really tough life, partly because of some awful stuff that happened when they were kids. So Evan decides to go back and fix it.

**PRODUCER GUY:** And I’m sure that works out perfectly for everyone involved.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Actually, it’s super easy, barely an inconvenience. He goes back, threatens her creepy dad, and when he comes back to the present, he and Kayleigh are happy college sweethearts!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, really?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, no. Her brother Tommy is now a violent psycho who tries to kill him. So Evan has to go back again.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Of course he does. Let me guess, he tries to stop a different traumatic event?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly! There was this incident with some dynamite. So he goes back to stop that.

**PRODUCER GUY:** And the new present is a beautiful utopia?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Not quite. In the new reality, he’s a double amputee, and his mom is dying of lung cancer from stress-smoking.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wow. So every time he tries to help, he just finds a new flavor of misery.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Pretty much! He creates a reality where he ends up in prison, one where Kayleigh is a drug-addicted prostitute, and one where his friend Lenny is in a mental institution.

**PRODUCER GUY:** This sounds like the bleakest movie of all time. I love it!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So finally, he realizes that the only way to make everyone’s life better is to make sure he and Kayleigh never even met. He goes back to the day they first met as kids.

**PRODUCER GUY:** And he gives a heartwarming speech about friendship and letting go?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Nope, he intentionally says something really mean to her so she’ll choose to live with her mom instead of her dad, thus avoiding him and all the trauma.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Being mean to children to solve problems is tight!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So in the end, he wakes up in a new present, his friends have had good lives, and he just walks past Kayleigh on the street like a stranger.

**PRODUCER GUY:** That’s it? That’s the ending?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, there's another version where he goes back to when he was in the womb and strangles himself with his own umbilical cord.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh my god!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah!

**PRODUCER GUY:** A dark, depressing movie with multiple downer endings starring that guy from "Punk'd"? This has niche appeal written all over it, which means it’ll probably be a huge hit for some reason.
