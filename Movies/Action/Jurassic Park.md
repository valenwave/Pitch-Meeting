**INT. STUDIO EXECUTIVE'S OFFICE - DAY**

PRODUCER GUY sips from a ridiculously large coffee mug emblazoned with "I MAKE MOVIES." SCREENWRITER GUY nervously clutches a stack of papers.

**PRODUCER GUY**
Alright, so what's this big idea you've been cooking up, Screenwriter Guy? Make it snappy. I've got a private jet to catch, and it's not going to fly itself.

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
Well, Producer Guy, imagine this: Dinosaurs. But, like, *real* dinosaurs. Living, breathing, eating-people dinosaurs!

**PRODUCER GUY**
(Spits coffee)
Dinosaurs? Like… stop-motion animation dinosaurs? We’re not making *King Kong* here, buddy.

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
No, no, Producer Guy! We've got this new technology! CGI! Computer-generated imagery! We can make them look absolutely, unbelievably real! And practical effects for the close-ups! Think big, think groundbreaking!

**PRODUCER GUY**
Okay, okay, I'm listening. So, you've got dinosaurs. Where are they? A zoo? A circus? Are they gonna sing and dance? Because I'm telling you, dancing dinosaurs would sell tickets.

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
Better! A theme park! A rich eccentric billionaire builds an island resort where people can come and see real, live dinosaurs. And it's called... wait for it... Jurassic Park!

**PRODUCER GUY**
Jurassic Park. So, like, a safari ride, but with ancient lizards? And this billionaire, is he like, a good guy? Does he learn a lesson?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
He's a visionary, Producer Guy! John Hammond! He wants to share this wonder with the world. But, you know, because it's a movie, things have to go horribly, horribly wrong.

**PRODUCER GUY**
Oh, of course they do. Because if nothing goes wrong, where's the sequel potential? So, what's the "horribly wrong" part? A rogue accountant? Too many hot dogs?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
No! A rogue computer programmer! He shuts down the park's security systems to steal dinosaur embryos! And then all the dinosaurs get out!

**PRODUCER GUY**
Wait, wait, wait. The *computer programmer* is the bad guy? Not, like, a velociraptor in a tiny fedora? And he just... *shuts everything down*? So the electrified fences turn off? The T-Rex paddock just... opens?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
Precisely! He's a genius, but a greedy one. And a little... unlucky. He gets eaten by a small, venom-spitting dinosaur.

**PRODUCER GUY**
A venom-spitting dinosaur? Is that, like, historically accurate? I feel like I'd remember reading about that in my dinosaur books. Also, why would a billionaire build a park where the *entire security system* relies on one guy not spilling his Jell-O on the keyboard? What about a backup generator? Or, you know, a lock on the door?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
(Sweats)
Uh, well, chaos theory, Producer Guy! Life finds a way! And it finds a way to shut down your power grid! And the main characters, they're stuck in the middle of it! A paleontologist who doesn't like kids, a paleobotanist, and a cynical mathematician! And Hammond's grandkids, of course!

**PRODUCER GUY**
A cynical mathematician? So he's gonna explain the odds of getting eaten by a T-Rex *while* being eaten by a T-Rex? That's... surprisingly on-brand for Hollywood. And the paleontologist who hates kids... so he'll end up, like, loving them by the end?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
You got it, Producer Guy! And the T-Rex! It's gonna be huge! It's gonna smash through a car! And then it's going to eat a lawyer off a toilet!

**PRODUCER GUY**
(Eyes widen)
A lawyer. On a toilet. You know, I think you've finally hit on something there, Screenwriter Guy. People *hate* lawyers. This is good. This is very good. And the Velociraptors! What about them? Are they singing?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
No! They're super smart! They hunt in packs! And they open doors! And they chase kids through a kitchen! It's terrifying!

**PRODUCER GUY**
Open doors? So, they're like, highly evolved? But also they can't figure out a giant freezer door? This sounds like a great idea! People love being scared. And then what? Do the dinosaurs just... take over the island?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
Well, they escape, but a few of the main characters manage to get off the island, barely. Leaving the dinosaurs to their own devices... for now.

**PRODUCER GUY**
"For now." I like that. Opens up the sequel. *Jurassic Park 2: Even More Dinosaurs*. Or *Jurassic Park 2: This Time, They Learn to Drive*. You know, I think this could actually work. People are going to love this.

**PRODUCER GUY**
(Leans back, a satisfied smirk on his face)
Alright, Screenwriter Guy. I think we've got a winner on our hands. This "Jurassic Park" idea? It's going to be huge.
