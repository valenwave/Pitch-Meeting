**PRODUCER GUY:** So you have a movie for me?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes sir, I do. It’s about a getaway driver, and we’re going to call it *Baby Driver*.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, so it’s about a baby who drives? That sounds adorable and completely irresponsible.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, no, his name is Baby. Well, his real name is Miles, but he goes by Baby.

**PRODUCER GUY:** “B-A-B-Y, Baby?”

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly! So he’s this super talented getaway driver who works for a crime boss named Doc to pay off a debt.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Let me guess, he stole Doc's car full of valuable merchandise when he was younger?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Wow, yes. How did you know?

**PRODUCER GUY:** It’s a classic, sir. So what’s this kid’s deal?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He has tinnitus from a childhood car accident that killed his parents, so he constantly listens to music on his iPods to drown out the ringing.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So the whole movie is going to have a killer soundtrack?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** You know it! The car chases, the shootouts, everything is choreographed to the music.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Musical action sequences are tight!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So, Baby is on his last job to pay off his debt. He meets this waitress named Debora and they fall in love instantly.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Of course they do. He probably wants to leave the life of crime for her, right?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Precisely! But Doc isn't having it. He strong-arms Baby into doing another heist by threatening Debora and his deaf foster father, Joseph.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh no! A classic villain move. Threatening the loved ones is always a good way to motivate the hero.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** The new heist crew is unhinged. There’s Buddy, his wife Darling, and a real psychopath named Bats.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Sounds like a fun bunch.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** During an arms deal, Bats figures out the sellers are cops and a massive shootout happens. Later, Bats makes Baby stop at the diner where Debora works. Baby has to stop Bats from killing her.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wow, that sounds incredibly stressful for a first date.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** You have no idea. So, during the big post office heist, Bats kills a security guard. Baby is horrified and refuses to drive. He ends up crashing the car, which impales and kills Bats.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, so he finally snaps!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Big time. Buddy and Darling are furious. There's a chase, a shootout with the police, and Darling gets killed. Buddy blames Baby for her death and wants revenge.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So now he has a very angry Jon Hamm after him. Yikes.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It’s going to be tough to escape that.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Actually, it’s going to be super easy, barely an inconvenience.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Oh really?

**PRODUCER GUY:** Yeah, Doc is going to have a change of heart and help them escape with money and a plan, right?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He does! But then Buddy shows up in a stolen police car and kills Doc.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wow wow wow wow!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Then there’s a big final showdown in a parking garage. Buddy shoots next to Baby's ears, deafening him. But Debora hits Buddy with a crowbar, and Baby shoots him, causing him to fall to his death.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So they get away and live happily ever after?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Not quite. They hit a police roadblock, and Baby decides to surrender. He goes to prison.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Aww, that’s a bummer.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** But wait! At his trial, all the people he was kind to, including Debora and his foster dad, testify on his behalf. He gets 25 years but is up for parole in five. The movie ends with him getting out and Debora is waiting for him.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A crime musical with a happy-ish ending? I love it! It sounds fresh and exciting. People are going to eat this up!
