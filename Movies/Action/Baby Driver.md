**PRODUCER GUY:** So, you have a movie for me?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes sir, I do. It’s an action movie that’s also kind of a musical.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A musical? Are people going to be bursting into song in the middle of a car chase?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, no, nothing like that. So our main character is this young getaway driver, and his name is Baby.

**PRODUCER GUY:** His name is Baby? Like an infant?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly. And he's the best getaway driver in the game, but he has tinnitus from a childhood accident, so he's constantly listening to music on his iPods to drown out the ringing.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So a job that requires him to be super aware of his surroundings, like listening for police sirens or gunshots, is being done by a guy who has his ears plugged with music all the time?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah! The idea is that he times all of his incredible driving moves to the beat of the song he's listening to. It’s super cool. We open on a bank robbery and he’s just jamming out in the car, and then when the crew gets in, he pulls off this amazing escape perfectly synced to the music.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wow wow wow… wow. That does sound pretty cool. So who’s he working for?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He works for a crime boss named Doc, played by Kevin Spacey.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oof. That casting might be tough to escape.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, see, Baby owes Doc a debt, so he’s forced to be his driver for a rotating crew of criminals. We’ve got this crazy, violent guy named Bats, and a Bonnie and Clyde-type couple named Buddy and Darling.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A bunch of dangerous criminals working with a guy named Baby. I’m sure they respect him a lot.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** They don't at first, but then they see his skills. So, Baby's almost paid off his debt, and he meets this beautiful waitress named Debora and they fall in love instantly. He wants to quit the criminal life, just grab Debora and drive off into the sunset.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, so he’s getting out of the game. I’m sure his crime boss will be totally fine with his best driver just leaving.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Actually, it’s going to be super easy, barely an inconvenience. Doc tells him they're square and he’s free to go.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, really?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, for a minute. Then Doc finds him at his new pizza delivery job and is like, "You're back in for one last job." He threatens to hurt Debora if Baby doesn't do it.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Ah, the classic "one last job." A trope as old as time itself.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It’s a classic for a reason! So this last job is to rob a post office, and the crew is Buddy, Darling, and the super unhinged Bats. The whole thing feels wrong, and Baby tries to bail, but he can't.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Let me guess, the job goes terribly wrong?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It goes so wrong. Bats kills a security guard for no reason, and then in the getaway, Baby causes a crash that impales Bats on some rebar.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Impaled? Yikes. So we’ve gone from a fun car-chase musical to people getting skewered.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly. The tone shifts! So Baby gets away from the crew and the cops in an epic foot chase. He’s running, jumping, parkouring all over the city.

**PRODUCER GUY:** He’s the best driver *and* the best parkour runner?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He’s very talented. So he gets back to Debora and they try to run, but the rest of the crew finds them. There's a big shootout with the police, Darling gets killed, and Buddy gets super mad.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So now the romantic criminal is a vengeful monster?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yep! He blames Baby for Darling's death. Then Doc, the crime boss, has a sudden change of heart and helps Baby and Debora escape, giving them cash and a car before getting killed by Buddy's crew.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A change of heart? The guy who threatened to break his girlfriend’s legs five minutes ago is now a noble hero?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It's a character arc. So this all leads to a final showdown in a parking garage between Baby and Buddy, who is now driving a stolen police car and trying to kill them.

**PRODUCER GUY:** He’s trying to kill a driving prodigy… in a car fight. Bold move.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It is! They play a game of chicken, Baby wins, and Buddy falls to his death. Baby is injured but he gets Debora to safety, only to find the police have him surrounded. He decides to surrender.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So he goes to jail?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He does. He gets a 25-year sentence, eligible for parole in five years. And we see Debora writing him letters and waiting for him. The movie ends with him getting out of prison and Debora is waiting for him with a cool car.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So the whole movie is this fast-paced, high-octane thrill ride, and it ends with the main character quietly going to jail for five years.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It subverts expectations! What do you think?

**PRODUCER GUY:** An action movie driven entirely by a killer soundtrack, starring a bunch of charming actors, and directed by a visionary filmmaker? I think critics are going to absolutely love this.
