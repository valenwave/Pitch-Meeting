**PRODUCER GUY:** So, you got a movie for me?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes sir, I do! Remember that movie about the cool magicians who were also criminals but in a charming way?

**PRODUCER GUY:** The one where the big twist was that the FBI agent chasing them the whole time was secretly their boss?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** That's the one! Well, I have a groundbreaking idea for a sequel. We're gonna do it again!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Astonishing. What's it called?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Now You See Me 2.

**PRODUCER GUY:** I see. So what are the Four Horsemen up to?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, it’s been a year, and they've just been hiding out, waiting for orders from the all-powerful secret magic society, The Eye.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So they're just sitting in an apartment doing nothing?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Pretty much! But their FBI leader, Dylan Rhodes, finally gives them a new mission to expose a corrupt tech CEO. Oh, and we have a new Horseman.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh yeah? What happened to the lady from the first movie?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** She got tired of hiding. It happens. The new one is Lula, she’s super quirky and fun.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Replacing a main cast member is tight!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So they go to hijack the tech CEO's big launch, but then a mysterious voice hijacks *their* show, revealing to the world that Jack Wilder is still alive and that Dylan is secretly a Horseman!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Whoops. Seems like a major security flaw for a super-secret magic organization.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It is! So to get away, they all jump down a giant escape tube on the roof.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A tube, huh? Where's it go?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** All the way to Macau, China!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wow wow wow… wow. They slid down a tube from New York to China? Was it cushioned?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Magic, sir. So they pop out in a restaurant in Macau and are immediately kidnapped and brought to a tech genius named Walter Mabry.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Let me guess, he’s played by a famous wizard.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Daniel Radcliffe, actually! He's a science prodigy who faked his own death and now he wants the Horsemen to steal a powerful computer chip for him.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Why them? Can't he use his science powers to get it?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He wants it done with flair! So they have to pull off this insane heist that involves them throwing the chip, which is stuck to a playing card, all around a super secure lab.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So the plan is to just fling one of the most advanced pieces of tech on Earth around like a hot potato?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** They've got very good hands! Meanwhile, Dylan goes to get Thaddeus Bradley—the magic debunker he framed and sent to prison—to help him out.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Why on Earth would that guy help him?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Reasons! So Thaddeus sends Dylan into a trap where he gets locked in the same model of safe his father died in.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, invoking some deep-seated trauma, I see.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It works! He escapes the safe and now he knows how his dad died! So after the Horsemen steal the chip, they find out Walter is the illegitimate son of Arthur Tressler, the guy they ruined in the first movie!

**PRODUCER GUY:** What a convenient and not at all forced connection!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Right? So Tressler and his son get the chip, capture Dylan, and throw him back in the safe to drown him for real this time. It’s going to be tough to escape that.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Actually, it’s going to be super easy, barely an inconvenience.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, really?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah, see, Jack just picks the lock on the safe while it’s sinking. And it turns out the Horsemen gave Walter a fake chip anyway!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Of course they did.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So for their grand finale, they perform a bunch of tricks across London, culminating in them getting on a private jet. But Walter and Tressler are on the jet! They take back the chip and throw all the Horsemen out of the plane to their deaths!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh my god! So all the main characters are dead! That’s a bold choice.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Not exactly. It’s then revealed that the plane never actually took off! They built a fake plane on a barge in the river and used rain and light machines to make it look real. The whole confrontation was broadcast to the world, so Tressler and Walter get arrested.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So let me get this straight. Their plan was to build a multi-million dollar television set on a boat just to trick two guys?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It was very cinematic! But wait, there’s one more twist! Thaddeus reveals to Dylan that he was never the bad guy. He was secretly Dylan's father's partner and a leader in The Eye all along! Framing himself and antagonizing Dylan was all part of a very, very long-term plan to guide him.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wait, what? The guy Dylan spent his entire adult life hating and plotting revenge against was secretly on his side? That doesn't really track with his actions in the first movie at all.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It’s a twist! And then he leads all the Horsemen down a secret staircase to finally meet The Eye.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Well, an overly complicated plot with twists that cancel out previous twists worked the first time, so why not? The kids will love all the flashy card throwing.
