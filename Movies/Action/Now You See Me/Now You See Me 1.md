**PRODUCER GUY:** So, you have a movie for me?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes sir, I do. It’s about a team of magicians who pull off elaborate heists during their shows.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, a magic heist movie! So we’ll have lots of misdirection and secrets and twists?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Oh, so many twists. You won’t know what’s real.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, tell me about these magicians.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Okay, so there are four of them. First is J. Daniel Atlas, he’s a super arrogant illusionist who talks really fast. Then there's Merritt McKinney, a mentalist who can hypnotize people. We also have Henley Reeves, an escape artist and Atlas's former assistant. And finally, Jack Wilder, a young street magician who's great at sleight of hand.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A real grab bag of magical talents. How do they meet?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** They each receive a mysterious tarot card from an unknown benefactor, which leads them to an apartment in New York City. Inside, they find holographic blueprints for an impossible magic trick.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Holograms from a mysterious stranger are tight!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** They are! So a year later, they’re a super famous magic act in Las Vegas called "The Four Horsemen," sponsored by an insurance billionaire named Arthur Tressler.

**PRODUCER GUY:** The guy from *Batman* is in this?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He sure is, sir. So for their big finale, they announce they're going to rob a bank in Paris… live on stage.

**PRODUCER GUY:** But they’re in Las Vegas. That’s pretty far from Paris.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** That’s the magic! They seemingly teleport an audience member into his bank vault in France, activate a giant vacuum, and suck out millions of Euros, which then rain down on the Las Vegas audience.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So they just committed international grand larceny and then gave the money away to a bunch of tourists?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly! So of course, this gets the attention of a very grumpy FBI agent named Dylan Rhodes, and an Interpol agent named Alma Dray.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, the Hulk is gonna get ‘em.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, he tries. He arrests the Horsemen, but they’re super cocky about it because, you know, how do you prove they used a teleportation vacuum to rob a bank? You can’t. They get released.

**PRODUCER GUY:** That must be incredibly frustrating for law enforcement.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It is. So Agent Rhodes goes to see Thaddeus Bradley, a famous magic debunker who exposes magicians' secrets for a living.

**PRODUCER GUY:** He’s played by God, right?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** That’s the one. And he explains the bank was probably robbed beforehand and it was all an elaborate illusion.

**PRODUCER GUY:** That makes a lot more sense.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So for their next show, the Horsemen drain their sponsor Arthur Tressler's bank account of $140 million and give it to the audience, who were all people Tressler's company denied insurance claims to.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wow, so they're like Robin Hoods with top hats. I like it.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** The FBI definitely does not like it. There’s a huge chase, and Jack Wilder ends up in a car that flips over and explodes in a massive fireball. He’s dead.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh my god, you killed one of the four horsemen? That's a bold move halfway through the movie!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It’s very bold, sir. So now the remaining three Horsemen announce their final act: stealing cash from a giant, impenetrable safe. They’re chased by the FBI onto a rooftop, where they jump off and seemingly vanish into a shower of money that rains on the crowd.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So they all died and turned into money? What is happening?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Nope! The money is fake, and the real magicians got away. But then the police find the *real* money from the safe stashed in Thaddeus Bradley's car.

**PRODUCER GUY:** The magic debunker? He was the mastermind?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Looks that way! He gets arrested, yelling that he’s been framed. But then the Horsemen meet up at a carousel, and Jack Wilder is there! He faked his own death!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wow wow wow… wow! What a twist!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** But wait, there’s more! FBI Agent Dylan Rhodes shows up and reveals that *he* was the secret fifth Horseman who planned everything from the start.

**PRODUCER GUY:** What? The guy chasing them was their leader the whole time? How does that work? Why would he do that? He seemed to be trying so hard to catch them.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, you see, his father was a magician who died performing a trick that Thaddeus Bradley debunked. The insurance company was Tressler's, the bank was the French bank, and the safe was from the company that built the faulty safe his dad drowned in. This whole thing was an insanely complex revenge plot against everyone who wronged his father.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So he sabotaged his own year-long FBI investigation, risking his entire career, just to get revenge? That seems incredibly difficult to manage.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Actually, it was super easy, barely an inconvenience.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, really?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah, you just have to be really good at looking frustrated with yourself.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So he gets arrested for orchestrating a massive conspiracy, right?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Nope. The Interpol agent figures it out, but she’s kinda into him, so she lets him get away with it. And he welcomes the Four Horsemen into a secret ancient order of magicians called "The Eye."

**PRODUCER GUY:** A secret magic society with a twist that completely falls apart if you think about it for more than five seconds? I love it! This is gonna be a huge hit!
