**PRODUCER GUY:** So, you have a superhero movie for me?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes sir, I do! So, you know how superheroes are always so noble and perfect and save the day without a single complaint?

**PRODUCER GUY:** I do. It’s what makes them so heroic.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, what if our superhero was a miserable, alcoholic jerk who causes millions of dollars in property damage every time he stops a crime?

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, I am listening very intently.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So the movie opens on this guy, Hancock. He's sleeping on a bench, drunk, and some kids wake him up to tell him there’s a car chase. So he flies off to stop it, but he’s still drunk, so he completely wrecks the freeway, destroys several cars, and impales a criminal's car on the top of a skyscraper.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So he saves the day while also being a massive public menace.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly! The whole city hates him. They boo him, they call him an A-hole. It's great. But then one day, he saves this PR guy named Ray, who gets his car stuck on a train track.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, good for him. How does he save him?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He stops the train by standing in front of it, which causes it to completely derail and crash.

**PRODUCER GUY:** He saved one guy by potentially endangering hundreds more.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** The math works out. So this PR guy, Ray, is super grateful and decides he’s going to fix Hancock’s public image. He has this whole plan.

**PRODUCER GUY:** And what’s the plan?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He wants Hancock to turn himself in and go to prison.

**PRODUCER GUY:** The super-powered man is going to voluntarily go to prison? How is Ray going to convince him to do that?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Actually, it’s super easy, barely an inconvenience.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, really?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah, Ray just gives him a little speech and Hancock is like, "Okay, sounds good." So he goes to jail. He even makes a big public apology first.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So he’s in a regular prison? With non-super people?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yep. And some of the guys in there are people he put away, so they try to fight him. He deals with it by shoving one guy’s head up another guy’s butt.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wow wow wow… wow. That seems anatomically challenging.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It’s a very memorable scene. So with Hancock in jail, the crime rate skyrockets and the city realizes they actually need him. Then there's a big bank robbery led by this guy with a hook for a hand, and the police chief has to swallow his pride and call Hancock for help.

**PRODUCER GUY:** And Hancock comes to save the day!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He sure does. He flies out of prison wearing a cool new leather superhero suit that Ray got for him, saves a cop, stops the bad guys, and even compliments the police chief. The whole city cheers for him!

**PRODUCER GUY:** So the PR plan worked perfectly.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Flawlessly. So to celebrate, Hancock goes to Ray’s house for a spaghetti dinner with Ray and his wife, Mary. But Mary seems to really hate Hancock for some reason.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Because he’s a historically destructive drunk who shoves heads up butts?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, it’s something else. So later, Hancock is telling Mary that Ray called him an angel, and he drunkenly tries to kiss her. And then she throws him through a wall with her own superpowers.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wait, what? She has powers too?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** She sure does! Turns out they are the last two of an ancient race of super-beings, like gods or angels, who were created in pairs. They’ve been together for 3,000 years.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Hold on. She’s an immortal super-being and she’s just been living as a suburban housewife this whole time and never mentioned it to her husband?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Seems that way, yes. And there’s a catch: when they are physically close to each other, they become mortal and lose their powers. That’s why Hancock can’t remember anything and has been so miserable; she left him 80 years ago after he was attacked and got amnesia so they could both be safe.

**PRODUCER GUY:** That seems like a pretty significant design flaw for beings who are supposed to be paired together.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It’s a whole thing. So they have a huge super-powered fight that destroys the street and a tornado gets involved somehow.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A tornado?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** A weather event happens. So now that they’re close to each other, Hancock starts getting weaker. He gets shot during a liquor store robbery and ends up in the hospital, fully mortal.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh no! So the big final villain must be coming to finish him off, right?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** That’s right! Remember that bank robber with the hook hand?

**PRODUCER GUY:** The guy from the middle of the movie? I thought we were done with him.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Nope! He and two other criminals Hancock put away see the news report about him being in the hospital, so they escape prison to go get their revenge.

**PRODUCER GUY:** It’s going to be tough for a de-powered Hancock to fight three guys.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Actually, it's super easy, barely an inconvenience.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, really?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah, because Mary, who is also getting weaker, shows up to help. Then Ray shows up and convinces one of the bad guys to help by chopping off the main bad guy's other hand with a fire axe. And then Hancock uses his last bit of strength to fly away from Mary so they can both heal.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So the solution is just… long-distance relationship?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Pretty much. He moves to New York to be their hero, and she stays in L.A. with Ray. And to show her he's okay, he flies up and paints a heart and her initial on the moon.

**PRODUCER GUY:** He vandalized the moon.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It’s a romantic gesture! So, what do you think?

**PRODUCER GUY:** A superhero who’s a drunken mess and the first half of the movie is a dark comedy about public relations, but then the second half is a surprise twist about immortal god-couples whose powers cancel each other out? It’s completely disjointed. I love it! People love Will Smith!
