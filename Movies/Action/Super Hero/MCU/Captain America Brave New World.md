**(SCENE START)**

**INT. PRODUCER'S OFFICE - DAY**

The PRODUCER GUY gestures with a fresh coffee, looking somewhat more confident than usual. The SCREENWRITER GUY looks like he's just finished running a marathon.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Alright, so, *Captain America: Brave New World*. We've got Sam Wilson, fully embracing the shield, right? No more "Is he worthy?" existential crises? Because that's super easy, barely an inconvenience.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly, sir! Sam Wilson is Captain America, and he's ready to lead! But he's facing a whole new set of challenges in a post-Blip, post-Avengers world. We're talking political thrillers, espionage, and a deep dive into what leadership means.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, it's like *Winter Soldier*, but with less Bucky and more... politics? People really want to see Captain America attend international summits?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, it's not *just* summits! Sam finds himself entangled in an international incident after meeting with President Thaddeus Ross!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Ah, President Ross! Played by Harrison Ford! So, he's the new guy in charge. Is he still, like, yelling at everyone and trying to weaponize super-soldiers?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He's trying to be a better man, sir! He's the newly elected President, and he actually wants Sam's help to reform the Avengers!

**PRODUCER GUY:** He wants *Sam* to restart the Avengers? The guy he threw in jail during Civil War? That's quite a turnaround. So, it's a buddy cop movie, but one of them is the President?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It's a complex dynamic! But beneath the surface, there's a nefarious global plot being orchestrated by **Dr. Samuel Sterns**, also known as **The Leader**!

**PRODUCER GUY:** The Leader? The guy from *The Incredible Hulk*? The one whose head started swelling up? So, he's finally embraced his super-intellect and is now, what, trying to outsmart the entire world with big brain moves?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Precisely! He's been imprisoned in a black site, Camp Echo One, for years, and he's using mind-control technology to manipulate people, including an assassination attempt on President Ross!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Mind control, you say? So, we're going to have characters suddenly turning on each other, just like that? Super convenient for plot twists. And speaking of old characters, **Isaiah Bradley** is back!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes! The original super-soldier! He was framed for an assassination attempt on Ross while under Sterns' mind control. It adds to the film's themes of legacy and the weight of the super-soldier program's dark history.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Right, because everyone loves a good conspiracy theory about government experiments. And what about new characters? Anyone cool that Sam can punch?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** We have **Joaquin Torres** fully embracing the role of the new **Falcon**! He's Sam's loyal wingman, eager to prove himself. And **Ruth Bat-Seraph**, a former Black Widow and security advisor to President Ross.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Another Falcon? And another Black Widow? Are we just recycling old characters with new faces now? Is there going to be a scene where they all stand together and go, "We're the new guys!"?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It's about passing the torch, sir! And eventually, the biggest threat emerges: President Ross himself transforms into the **Red Hulk**!

**PRODUCER GUY:** The Red Hulk?! So Harrison Ford turns into a giant, angry, red monster? That's why he was cast, isn't it? Because people wanted to see Han Solo punch things as a Hulk! That's what people pay money for!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It's a massive, climactic showdown! Sam, without superpowers, has to use his strategic mind and human ingenuity to face off against this incredibly powerful foe. It really emphasizes that his true superpower is empathy and leadership.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Empathy and leadership. Right. While a giant red man is smashing up the White House. Sounds like a very nuanced superhero movie. And the Celestial from *Eternals*? I heard that giant space guy is part of this too?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** The discovery of adamantium on "Celestial Island" is a major plot point, leading to a race between the US and Japan! It all ties into Sterns' plan!

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, a political thriller about a giant red monster, a mind-controlling genius, and a magical metal island. Is there, like, a talking animal sidekick in there somewhere? Just to lighten the mood?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** (Chuckles nervously) Not in this one, sir. But it sets the stage for a whole new era of Captain America, and the potential for a new Avengers team!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Of course it does. Always setting up the next thing. Alright, *Captain America: Brave New World*. Sounds like it's going to be a lot of rage, a lot of politics, and a lot of... red. Just make sure that Red Hulk fight is truly epic. People want to see a former President smash stuff.
