**PRODUCER GUY:** So you have a new Marvel movie for me?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes sir, I do! It's an origin story for a brand new hero!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, fantastic. Origin stories are my favorite. It’s not like we’ve done a dozen of those already.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well this one is different! Our hero is Shang-Chi, and he's living in San Francisco working as a valet named Shaun with his best friend Katy.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Shaun the valet? Sounds like a thrilling superhero.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** See, he’s secretly a master martial artist who ran away from his past. And his past is about to catch up to him when a bunch of assassins attack him on a city bus for a pendant his mom gave him.

**PRODUCER GUY:** An epic fight scene on a bus? Fighting on public transportation is tight!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It is! And Shaun, I mean, Shang-Chi, fights them all off in this super cool, choreographed sequence, much to the shock of his friend Katy, who has to take over driving the bus after the driver gets knocked out.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So this random valet is suddenly Jackie Chan and his best friend becomes a stunt driver?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly! So Shang-Chi knows they're after his sister's matching pendant, so he and Katy fly to Macau to warn her.

**PRODUCER GUY:** And I assume she's living a quiet life as well?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** She runs an underground fight club in a skyscraper!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Of course she does.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So they get there and have a bit of a family reunion battle on the scaffolding outside the building, and then their dad shows up.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Let me guess, he's a mild-mannered accountant?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He’s Wenwu, the centuries-old, immortal leader of the Ten Rings criminal organization who wields ten mystical rings that give him super powers. He's also the actual Mandarin.

**PRODUCER GUY:** The Mandarin? Didn't we already do that in *Iron Man 3* with the actor guy?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** We’re going to get to him! So Wenwu captures his kids and Katy and reveals his master plan: he's been hearing his dead wife's voice, and he thinks she's being held captive in her mystical home village of Ta Lo. So he's going to go break her out.

**PRODUCER GUY:** His dead wife is calling to him from beyond the grave telling him to attack a magical village? That sounds super healthy and not at all like a trap.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So his kids tell him it's a terrible idea, and he imprisons them. But in the dungeon, they meet Trevor Slattery!

**PRODUCER GUY:** The actor guy! We are bringing him back! Why?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Because he has a weird, furry, faceless creature-pet named Morris who knows the way to Ta Lo!

**PRODUCER GUY:** So finding this legendary hidden village is going to be difficult, I assume?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Actually, it’s going to be super easy, barely an inconvenience.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, really?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah, we just follow the weird butt-faced dog thing through a magical moving bamboo forest.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Perfect.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So they get to Ta Lo, meet their aunt, and find out a giant soul-sucking demon called the Dweller-in-Darkness is the one mimicking their mother's voice to trick Wenwu into opening the gate it’s trapped behind.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, a classic case of a grief-stricken warlord being catfished by an interdimensional soul-eater. Happens all the time.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So Wenwu and his army show up and attack the village. Wenwu starts punching the gate with his ten super rings, which cracks it open and lets out the Dweller's little soul-sucking minions.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Whoops.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Whoops indeed. So there's a huge battle with dragons and monsters, and Shang-Chi has to fight his dad. Wenwu eventually realizes he’s been tricked, sacrifices himself to save Shang-Chi, and gives him the Ten Rings.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A last-minute change of heart that gives our hero the power-up he needs. Love it.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Shang-Chi, now super-powered, teams up with a giant water dragon and his sister and Katy—who has suddenly become an expert archer—to kill the Dweller-in-Darkness.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So the valet, the fight club owner, and the other valet save the world. What a team.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Then we see Shang-Chi and Katy back in San Francisco telling their friends about this crazy adventure, but nobody believes them. Then Wong from Doctor Strange just portals into the bar and is like, "We need to talk about those rings."

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, a post-credits scene setup in the main movie! Bold!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Then in the actual mid-credits scene, Wong has them on a hologram call with Bruce Banner, who is not Smart Hulk anymore for some reason, and Captain Marvel, who has different hair for some reason, and they discover the rings are like a super ancient beacon.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Keeping our continuity straight is tight! So, what do you think?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, it's a completely new character that audiences aren't familiar with, but it has amazing fight scenes and a giant dragon. I think it’ll do okay.
