**PRODUCER GUY:** So you have a new Marvel movie for me?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes sir, I do. This one is going to be a little different, a bit more… cerebral. It’s called "Eternals."

**PRODUCER GUY:** "Eternals," huh? Sounds like a long-term investment. What’s the story?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So, there's this group of ten immortal beings who were sent to Earth thousands of years ago by a giant space god named Arishem.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A giant space god. Is he going to have a cool, deep voice?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** The deepest. So these Eternals have been protecting humanity from these monster creatures called Deviants. They’ve been living among us in secret for centuries.

**PRODUCER GUY:** In secret? So they just, what, get regular jobs? Does one of them become a famous Bollywood star?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Wow, you’re good at this! Yes, his name is Kingo and he’s a huge Bollywood sensation.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Of course he is. So what's the problem? The Deviants are back?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly! A new, more evolved Deviant named Kro shows up and starts causing trouble. So the Eternals have to get the band back together.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Let me guess, it’s complicated.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Super complicated. There’s Sersi, who can manipulate matter and is in a love triangle with Ikaris, who can fly and shoot lasers from his eyes, and a human guy named Dane Whitman.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, a classic love triangle. Do the other eight have equally dramatic personal lives?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Pretty much. There's Sprite, who looks like a kid forever and is secretly in love with Ikaris. Phastos is a tech genius who's the first openly gay superhero in the MCU. Makkari is super fast and deaf. Druig can mind-control people. Thena has a form of superhero PTSD called Mahd Wy'ry. And Gilgamesh is super strong and takes care of her. And Ajak is their leader.

**PRODUCER GUY:** That is a lot of people with a lot of issues. So they fight the Deviants, save the day, the end?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Not exactly. See, Ajak gets killed, and then Sersi becomes the new leader and finds out their whole mission was a lie.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A lie? I love a good twist!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It turns out they weren’t just sent to kill Deviants. They were sent to help the human population grow so that a new Celestial, Tiamut, could emerge from the Earth's core.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Emerge? Like, hatch?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly. But the emergence will destroy the Earth and everyone on it.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Whoops! That's a pretty big detail to leave out of the job description.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It is! So now the Eternals are split. Ikaris is a true believer and wants the emergence to happen. The others, led by Sersi, want to save humanity.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So it's basically a superhero civil war.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** You could say that. There's a big fight on a beach and everything. Sersi eventually uses her powers, combined with the others in a "Uni-Mind," to turn the emerging Celestial into marble.

**PRODUCER GUY:** She turns a giant space baby into a statue. That's... creative. What happens to Ikaris?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He feels super guilty and flies into the sun.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So he's... dead?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It would seem so, sir. Then some of the Eternals fly off into space to find other Eternals and tell them the truth. The ones who stay on Earth get yoinked into space by Arishem, who's not happy they stopped the emergence. He says he's going to judge humanity based on their memories.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A cliffhanger! Bold. And what about the human boyfriend?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Oh, he’s about to tell Sersi a big family secret when she gets taken. Then in a post-credits scene, he opens a box with a cool sword and a mysterious voice asks if he's ready.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Cameos and sequels, the lifeblood of this business! I like it. It’s got cosmic stakes, emotional drama, and a whole bunch of new heroes to make toys of. This is going to be huge!
