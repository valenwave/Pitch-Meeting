**PRODUCER GUY:** So, you have a spy thriller for me?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes sir, I do! It stars Angelina Jolie as a CIA agent named Evelyn Salt.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Salt? Like the stuff I put on my popcorn?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly the same. So, the movie starts and she’s a happy, well-respected CIA agent. But then this Russian defector walks into her office and accuses her of being a secret Russian sleeper agent who's going to assassinate the Russian President.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh my god. Well, I assume she’ll spend the rest of the movie using her skills and contacts to prove her innocence.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Not exactly. She’s going to prove her innocence by immediately escaping custody in the most guilty-looking way possible.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Of course she is.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah! She’ll be running barefoot across the tops of moving trucks, tasering her co-workers, and building a makeshift rocket launcher out of a fire extinguisher and some office furniture to blow a hole in a wall.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Committing numerous felonies to prove you’re not a traitor is tight!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It sure is, sir. So her boss, Ted Winter, and her other colleague, Peabody, have to lead the hunt for her. And she does not make it easy for them.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So while she's on the run, is she secretly gathering evidence to clear her name?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Nope! She dyes her hair black, jumps off an overpass onto a moving semi, and then goes to New York City and successfully assassinates the Russian President during a funeral.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So… the Russian defector was right? She *is* a villain?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, yes, but also no, but also yes.

**PRODUCER GUY:** My brain just did a somersault.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** See, she really *is* a Russian sleeper agent who was raised from childhood in a secret Soviet program to infiltrate America. But then she fell in love with her husband, an arachnologist, and that made her a good guy for real. So now she’s pretending to be a bad guy again so she can get close to the real bad guys to stop their plan.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So she’s a double-double agent. Got it. This is spy stuff 101. So how does she prove to the other sleeper agents that she’s back on their team?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** They test her loyalty by having her watch them murder her husband right in front of her.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh wow. She must break down and blow her cover.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Nope, she just stares blankly, which convinces them she’s still evil. She’s super broken up about it on the inside, though.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Right. The classic "internal grief, external stoicism" method of gaining trust.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So now for the big twist! It turns out the Russian President isn't actually dead! Salt shot him with a needle full of spider venom to induce a death-like paralysis.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Spider venom? Where did she get that?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** From her husband, the arachnologist! Remember him? He was from earlier in the movie.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, a conveniently placed Chekhov's Spider-Husband!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** You know it! And the real plan is to get the US President to launch nuclear missiles. And the mastermind isn't the defector, it's her own CIA boss, Ted Winter! He's a sleeper agent too!

**PRODUCER GUY:** What?! This Russian sleeper agent program seems to have a fantastic placement rate within the highest levels of U.S. intelligence.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So Winter gets himself and the President locked down in the ultra-secure White House bunker to launch the nukes. It's totally impenetrable.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh no! It’s going to be impossible for Salt to get in there and stop him.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Actually, it’s going to be super easy, barely an inconvenience.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, really?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah, she just kind of sneaks in, rappels down an elevator shaft, and fights her way through the Secret Service.

**PRODUCER GUY:** The White House might want to invest in some elevator shaft grates. Seems like a pretty big security oversight.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So she gets in, strangles Winter to death with a pair of handcuffs, and aborts the nuclear launch just in time.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Fantastic! So she saves the world and everyone realizes she was a hero all along.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Not quite. She’s immediately arrested because she still looks like a traitor who just assassinated a world leader and broke into the White House.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Well, that seems reasonable.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So as they're flying her away in a helicopter, she tells Agent Peabody that there are still other sleeper agents out there and she’s the only one who can stop them.

**PRODUCER GUY:** And he believes her? After everything she’s done?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He sure does! So he uncuffs her and she just jumps out of the moving helicopter into the Potomac River to escape.

**PRODUCER GUY:** He just lets a prisoner, accused of treason and multiple murders, jump out of a helicopter to freedom? That man is getting fired so hard.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** But it perfectly sets up a sequel!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Angelina Jolie doing a bunch of insane stunts with more twists than a pretzel factory? Yeah, this has summer blockbuster written all over it. I can't see how this won't launch a massive franchise!
