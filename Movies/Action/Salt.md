**PRODUCER GUY:** So, you have a spy thriller for me?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes sir, I do! It’s about a badass CIA agent named Evelyn Salt.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Salt, huh? Is she going to be very salty?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** She has her moments. So the movie opens with her being brutally tortured in a North Korean prison.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wow, starting off light, I see.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Don't worry, her boyfriend, who is an arachnologist, pressures the government to arrange a prisoner swap and she gets freed.

**PRODUCER GUY:** An arachnologist? Did he threaten to release his spider collection in Congress or something?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Unclear. So, flash forward two years and Salt is working a desk job when a Russian defector walks into the office. He claims there's a secret group of Russian sleeper agents trained since childhood to destroy America, and one of them is about to assassinate the Russian president.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh no! Who is it?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Evelyn Salt.

**PRODUCER GUY:** The main character of the movie! What are the odds?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Pretty high in a movie named after her. So her colleagues, who have known her for years, immediately believe this random defector and try to arrest her.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Right. Well, it must be pretty hard to escape from a secure CIA interrogation room.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Actually, it’s super easy, barely an inconvenience.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, really?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah, she just takes off her heels, builds a makeshift cannon out of a table leg and a fire extinguisher, blows the door off its hinges, and then runs barefoot out of the building, climbs down the side, and jumps between moving trucks on the highway.

**PRODUCER GUY:** She did all that without shoes? I stub my toe on my coffee table and I’m out of commission for a week.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** She’s very resilient. So now she's a fugitive, and the big question is: is she a Russian spy or is she being framed?

**PRODUCER GUY:** I’m on the edge of my seat. I assume she’s going to work tirelessly to find the real culprit and clear her name.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Sort of. First, she’s going to go to New York City and carry out the assassination of the Russian President exactly as foretold.

**PRODUCER GUY:** What? So she proves her innocence by confirming everyone’s suspicions?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It’s an unconventional legal strategy, for sure. So after that she surrenders, gets put in a police car, and then immediately escapes again.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Of course she does.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Then she meets up with the Russian defector and a whole crew of other sleeper agents on a barge, and they’re all like "Welcome home, comrade!"

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wow wow wow… wow. So she *is* a bad guy! I was so sure she wasn’t.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** She is! And to prove her loyalty is still strong, the head spy brings out her spider-expert husband and has him killed right in front of her.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh my God! That’s terrible. So now she’s a completely ruthless, cold-hearted villain.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Absolutely. So then she immediately kills the head spy and every single other sleeper agent on the entire barge.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wait, what? Why?! I thought they were her lifelong spy-buddies!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** They were, but they also just murdered her husband. She’s a little upset about that.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So… she’s a good guy again? My brain hurts.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly! So now that she’s a good guy who just killed the bad guys, she decides to carry on with their plan to assassinate the President of the United States.

**PRODUCER GUY:** I can’t do this anymore. My allegiance whiplash has whiplash.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** She infiltrates the White House and follows the President into his super-secure underground bunker. And that’s when we get the big twist!

**PRODUCER GUY:** The President’s dog is the mastermind?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, her old CIA boss, Ted Winter, is actually a Russian sleeper agent too! He was the real big bad all along! He kills almost everyone in the bunker and tries to launch America’s nukes to start World War III.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So the guy in charge of catching the spies was secretly the head spy?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** You got it. He thinks Salt is there to help him, but she fights him and manages to abort the nuclear launch just in time.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Phew. So she saves the world but now she’s a wanted fugitive who appears to have just tried to start a nuclear war. It’s going to be tough to escape that.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Not really. The one agent who kind of believes her story is flying her away in a helicopter, so he just uncuffs her and lets her jump out into the Potomac River to escape.

**PRODUCER GUY:** He lets a suspected international super-spy just… jump out of a helicopter?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah, so she can go hunt down the remaining sleeper agents on her own. It perfectly sets up a sequel!

**PRODUCER GUY:** That we’re never going to make, are we?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Oh, almost certainly not.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A spy movie where nobody, including the audience, knows whose side the hero is on until the last ten minutes? It sounds confusing, chaotic, and frankly, kind of awesome. I love it!
