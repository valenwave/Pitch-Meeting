**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So, I’ve got a new movie idea for you, sir.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh boy, another one? Let me guess, it’s a romantic comedy where the main characters hate each other at first but then fall in love over a shared love of artisanal pickles.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, sir, nothing like that. This is a sci-fi action movie.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Sci-fi action? You mean like, spaceships and laser guns?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Kinda. So, the main character is this guy named Thomas Anderson. By day, he's a programmer for a big software company.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Zzzzzzz.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** But by night, he’s a hacker who goes by the name Neo.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Ooh, a secret identity! So he’s like a superhero, but instead of fighting crime he just, like, steals people's credit card information?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Not exactly. See, Neo has always felt like there’s something wrong with the world. He doesn’t know what it is, but he’s been searching for the answer.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Let me guess, the answer is that he’s secretly the chosen one who’s destined to save the world?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Wow, you’re good at this.

**PRODUCER GUY:** It’s a gift.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So, one day, Neo is contacted by this mysterious woman named Trinity. She tells him that she knows what he’s been looking for, and that she can introduce him to the man who has the answers: Morpheus.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Morpheus? Like the Greek god of dreams? Is this gonna be one of those movies where it was all a dream at the end?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Not quite. So Neo meets Morpheus, and Morpheus tells him that the world he knows is a lie.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Dun dun DUN!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He tells him that the year is actually closer to 2199, and that humanity is at war with intelligent machines that they created.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So it's a Terminator rip-off. Got it.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Not at all! See, in this world, the machines have taken over and are using humans as a source of energy. They keep the humans in these pods, and they’ve created a computer simulation called the Matrix to keep their minds occupied.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, the entire world is basically a giant video game?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly! And Morpheus believes that Neo is “The One,” a prophesied figure who has the power to manipulate the Matrix and end the war.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Of course he is.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So Morpheus offers Neo a choice: take the blue pill, and he'll wake up in his bed and believe whatever he wants to believe. Or, take the red pill, and he'll see how deep the rabbit hole goes.

**PRODUCER GUY:** I'm guessing he takes the red pill. Otherwise, we don't have a movie.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He takes the red pill.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Shocking.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** And he wakes up in the real world, which is this dark, post-apocalyptic wasteland.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Sounds delightful. So what happens next? Does he just, like, start fighting robots?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Not right away. First, he has to go through a bunch of training. They teach him how to bend the rules of the Matrix, so he can do things like dodge bullets and jump between buildings.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So it’s like a superhero training montage.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Pretty much. And then, they go on a mission to rescue Morpheus, who's been captured by the Agents, these sentient programs that act as the gatekeepers of the Matrix.

**PRODUCER GUY:** And let me guess, there’s a big, epic fight scene at the end?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** The biggest, most epic fight scene you've ever seen. Neo faces off against Agent Smith, the leader of the Agents, in this crazy, reality-bending showdown.

**PRODUCER GUY:** And Neo wins, obviously.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, he dies first.

**PRODUCER GUY:** He what now?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He gets shot, like, a bunch of times. But then Trinity tells him she loves him and that the Oracle told her she would fall in love with The One, and he comes back to life with even more power.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So the power of love literally brings him back from the dead?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It’s a metaphor!

**PRODUCER GUY:** A very convenient metaphor. So he beats Agent Smith and saves the day?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He realizes his full potential and destroys Smith from the inside out. Then he makes a phone call to the machines, telling them he's going to show people a world without rules and controls, and then he flies off into the sky.

**PRODUCER GUY:** He can fly now?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He’s The One!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Alright, I'm in. A chosen one, a simulated reality, slow-motion bullet-dodging, and the power of love saving the day. It’s got all the ingredients for a hit. This is going to be huge.
