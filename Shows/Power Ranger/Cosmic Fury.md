**Producer Guy:** Alright, so we've done the time-traveling cops, the paleontologist mentors, the magical elemental rangers... What's next for our *Power Rangers* franchise? Are we, like, sending them to the moon to fight space pirates who are also, like, bakers?

**Screenwriter Guy:** We've got *Power Rangers Cosmic Fury*! It's a direct continuation of *Dino Fury*, but this time, our Rangers are going galactic! Lord Zedd is back, and he's more powerful than ever!

**Producer Guy:** Lord Zedd is *back*?! I thought he was, like, purified at the end of *Countdown to Destruction*! So he's, like, evil again? Did he just, like, accidentally fall into a vat of bad vibes?

**Screenwriter Guy:** Well, we had a comic book tie-in that showed how he reverted to his evil form. But for the show, he's just... back! And he's got a new, massive Zord, the Serpentera, and he's conquering planets across the universe!

**Producer Guy:** Serpentera! That giant, terrifying dragon Zord that almost destroyed Earth way back when! So, he's got that thing and he's just, like, going on a galactic vacation of destruction? What about our *Dino Fury* Rangers? Are they just, like, sitting around waiting for him to get to Earth?

**Screenwriter Guy:** No! They're actually on the planet Eltar, Zordon's home planet, when Zedd attacks! They lose their Dino Fury powers and have to find new Cosmic Orbs to become the Cosmic Fury Rangers!

**Producer Guy:** They lose their powers?! So, they're, like, stranded aliens on Zordon's home planet with no way to fight back? That's a pretty intense opening! So, these Cosmic Orbs, do they just, like, give them sparkly new suits?

**Screenwriter Guy:** They give them new, space-themed suits, and new powers related to different constellations and cosmic energy! Amelia, the Pink Ranger, becomes the Red Ranger and leader! And Zayto, the original Red Ranger, becomes the Zenith Ranger, with, like, even more cosmic powers!

**Producer Guy:** So, a Pink Ranger becomes the Red Ranger leader! That's a cool shift in dynamic! And the original Red Ranger gets super-duper cosmic powers! So, they're, like, space warlords now?

**Screenwriter Guy:** More like space defenders! Izzy's the Green Ranger, Javi's the Black Ranger, Ollie's the Blue Ranger, and Fern, Izzy's girlfriend, actually becomes the Orange Ranger!

**Producer Guy:** An Orange Ranger! That's a new color! And Izzy's girlfriend becomes a Ranger! So, we're expanding the team organically, with existing characters! I like it! What about their Zords? Are they, like, giant spaceships?

**Screenwriter Guy:** They're animal-themed Zords that can combine into a new Cosmic Fury Megazord! There's a Cosmic Lion, Cosmic Shark, Cosmic Dragon... and the Zenith Ranger has the Cosmic Pegasus Zord!

**Producer Guy:** Cosmic animal Zords! That's awesome! And a Pegasus! So, it's a cosmic adventure, a race across the universe to stop Lord Zedd. What kind of other villains do they encounter? Does Zedd have, like, a really grumpy, cosmic minion?

**Screenwriter Guy:** He's got Squillia, a new alien general, and Bajillia, another general who's, like, a cosmic bounty hunter. Plus, he's got his classic foot soldiers, the Putties, but they're, like, *cosmic* Putties now!

**Producer Guy:** Cosmic Putties! So, they're, like, extra squishy now? What about Solon, the wise Pterodactylian mentor from *Dino Fury*? Does she get to go to space too?

**Screenwriter Guy:** Yes! Solon is with them and provides guidance and technical support from their mobile Command Center, which is now their spaceship!

**Producer Guy:** A mobile Command Center! So, they're like a space-faring superhero team, chasing Zedd across the galaxy. And it all culminates in a massive showdown with Zedd and Serpentera! This is going to be epic! But does Zedd, at any point, accidentally zap himself with one of his own cosmic rays, turning his staff into, like, a giant lollipop? That's good, karmic villainy.

**Screenwriter Guy:** I don't think he turns his staff into a lollipop, but there are definitely some surprising twists with Zedd. And the ending is a major moment for the Power Rangers legacy.

**Producer Guy:** So, it's a cosmic epic, a continuation of a beloved team, a battle against a classic villain, and a story about finding new strength in unexpected places. I love it! Just make sure there are plenty of satisfying space battles. And maybe, just maybe, the Cosmic Dragon Zord can, like, breathe actual stars. That would be cool.

**Screenwriter Guy:** I think we can definitely get some star-breathing in there.
