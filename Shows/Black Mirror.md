**PRODUCER GUY:** So, what's this new show idea you've got?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Okay, so it's an anthology series, right? Each episode is a standalone story.

**PRODUCER GUY:** An anthology? Like *The Twilight Zone*?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah, but instead of Rod Serling and monsters, it's... technology.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Technology? So, like, a show about iPhones? That sounds *riveting*.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, no, not *about* them. It's about how technology twists us, how it can bring out the worst in humanity. Like, imagine a world where social media ratings determine your entire life, your job, your house, everything!

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, like, Yelp, but for people? That's... actually kind of terrifying. But also, people love being validated. What's the conflict?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, the main character, Lacie, she's obsessed with getting her score up. She practices her fake smiles in the mirror, she gives five-star ratings to everyone, and then she gets invited to this fancy wedding that could boost her score through the roof!

**PRODUCER GUY:** And then? She spills wine on the bride and her score tanks?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Worse! Everything that can go wrong, does. Her car breaks down, she alienates people, her score plummets, and she ends up in jail for being... unpopular.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So the moral is: don't be obsessed with social media? Groundbreaking. What else you got?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Okay, how about this: the Prime Minister of Britain has to have sex with a pig on live television to save a kidnapped princess.

**PRODUCER GUY:** ...A pig? Like, an actual farm animal?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes! And the entire nation is watching, glued to their screens, because the kidnapper demanded it be broadcast.

**PRODUCER GUY:** And... he does it? On television? The *Prime Minister*?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, he tries to find a workaround, but then the kidnapper leaks the attempts to fake it, and public opinion turns against him, forcing his hand.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, this is a show about, what, the moral depravity of the internet? The mob mentality? The unblinking "black mirror" of our screens reflecting our worst selves?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly! It's all about the dark side of our interconnected world, how we become slaves to the very tech we create.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, it's generally depressing, then? No happy endings?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Most of the time, no. It's a look at the horrifying possibilities of where we're headed.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Huh. You know what? People love being told how terrible things are. This could actually work. It's got that high-concept, "what if" factor. I think we've got a winner!
