PRODUCER GUY: So, what have you got for me today?
SCREENWRITER GUY: Okay, so it's an anthology series, right? Like The Twilight Zone.
PRODUCER GUY: Oh, The Twilight Zone! I love that show. Rod Serling, he was a genius. Very timely. Very... well, twilight-y. So what's your twist? Is it like, about... aliens? Or spooky mansions?
SCREENWRITER GUY: No, no. It's about technology. And how it's, uh, ruining us.
PRODUCER GUY: Technology? Like... cell phones? The internet? Is this a PSA? Because nobody watches PSAs. Unless it's got a talking dog. Does it have a talking dog?
SCREENWRITER GUY: No talking dogs. But imagine a world where social media ratings determine your entire social status. Where your housing, your job, even your ability to rent a car, depends on how many five-star ratings you get from strangers.
PRODUCER GUY: So, like, Yelp, but for people? That sounds... awful. Who would watch that?
SCREENWRITER GUY: Exactly! It's awful. It's a commentary on our hyper-connected, validation-seeking society! There's an episode where a woman, Lacie, tries so hard to boost her score for a wedding, and it just spirals out of control. She ends up in jail!
PRODUCER GUY: Jail! For being unpopular? That's ridiculous! But... also, strangely compelling. What else you got?
SCREENWRITER GUY: Okay, how about this: the Prime Minister of Britain is forced to have sex with a pig on live television to save a kidnapped princess.
PRODUCER GUY: [Stares blankly] ...A pig? Like, a real, actual pig? Not a metaphorical pig?
SCREENWRITER GUY: A real pig. On live TV. And the whole world watches. And they're all like, "Oh, gross, but also, what's going to happen next?"
PRODUCER GUY: So you're saying people would actually watch the Prime Minister... with a pig? I mean, I guess it's certainly a bold creative choice. People do love a spectacle. But who's gonna be okay with that? The censors?
SCREENWRITER GUY: That's the point! It's about how quickly we get desensitized, and how media exploits our morbid curiosity.
PRODUCER GUY: [Nods slowly] Morbid curiosity... I like that. We can put that in the marketing. "Black Mirror: Exploiting Your Morbid Curiosity Since [whenever this airs]." What about a happy one? Can't it all be doom and gloom? People like a happy ending sometimes.
SCREENWRITER GUY: Well, there's one about a virtual reality afterlife where you can live forever as a younger version of yourself, and fall in love, and it's all sunshine and rainbows! It's called "San Junipero."
PRODUCER GUY: See! I knew you had it in you! So it's not all about technology being bad, sometimes it's good! It's about hope!
SCREENWRITER GUY: Well, yes, but it's also about whether true connection can exist when you can essentially turn off reality, and if it's really living if you're not... actually alive.
PRODUCER GUY: [Sighs] Alright, alright. Always a catch, isn't there? So, it's basically a show where technology makes everyone miserable, or sometimes slightly less miserable but still in a way that makes you question the nature of existence.
SCREENWRITER GUY: Pretty much. And each episode is different, so people don't get bored. And they'll constantly be wondering, "Is this what our future holds?"
PRODUCER GUY: You know what? I think you've got something here. It's bleak, it's unsettling, it's got pigs and social media ratings. People love watching other people suffer, especially if it makes them feel superior about not having to live in that particular technological nightmare. This show is going to be HUGE.
