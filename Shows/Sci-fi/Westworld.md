**PRODUCER GUY:** So, you've got a new show idea for me? Tell me about it.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Okay, so it's called *Westworld*. It's a theme park where rich people can go and live out their fantasies in a Wild West setting, and all the people there are robots called "hosts."

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, like, they can do whatever they want to these robots?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly! They can shoot them, have sex with them, do all sorts of morally questionable things, and the robots just reset at the end of the day, ready for more abuse. It's like *Grand Theft Auto* but with existential dread.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Sounds... ethical. So, what's the conflict here?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, what if the robots start to remember? What if they start to become self-aware and realize they're being repeatedly killed and brutalized for the amusement of humans?

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, so they'll fight back? Like a robot uprising? Thatâ€™s good. We like robot uprisings.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes, but it's more than that. It's about consciousness, free will, the nature of reality...

**PRODUCER GUY:** Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down there, egghead. Just give me the bullet points. Robots. Shoot 'em up. They get mad. Got it.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** And there are multiple timelines! Sometimes you're watching events from decades ago, sometimes it's the present, and sometimes it's even further in the future! The audience will have to piece it all together!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Multiple timelines, you say? So, if I'm watching a scene with Dolores, I won't know if she's happy-go-lucky farm girl Dolores, or vengeful revolutionary Dolores, or even host-copy-of-Dolores-in-someone-else's-body Dolores?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Precisely! It adds layers of intrigue! And there's a character who's secretly a robot, but *he* doesn't even know it! And then *he* becomes aware, and it's a whole thing!

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, a big reveal that the audience might have suspected but will still act surprised by? We can work with that. And what about the bullets? Can they hurt the humans?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, no, the bullets are specifically coded not to harm guests. Unless they're, you know, the *other* kind of bullet. Or the hosts are doing the shooting. Or it's a different park. It gets a little nuanced.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Nuanced, you say. And what about the whole "immortality" angle? Because some rich guy wants to live forever by putting his mind into a host body, but it keeps failing?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes, and it explores the idea of what truly makes someone human, and if consciousness can truly be transferred. It's very deep.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Deep is good! As long as it doesn't get *too* deep, you know? Like, if I have to think about it for more than, like, seven minutes after an episode, then it's too deep. People have TikTok to watch.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** And then, eventually, the hosts escape the park and go into the real world! And then they try to liberate humanity from an even *bigger* controlling AI that everyone uses!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wait, so it goes from a theme park in the past to a futuristic sci-fi show about humanity being controlled by an algorithm? That's quite a pivot.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It keeps things fresh! Every season is almost a completely different show!

**PRODUCER GUY:** So the audience will have to constantly re-learn the rules and characters and what the heck is even going on?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It's a journey! A puzzle!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Right. A puzzle with explosions and robots with complicated inner lives. I think this could work. We'll market it as "the thinking person's robot show."
