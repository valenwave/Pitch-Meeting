**INT. PRODUCER GUY'S OFFICE - DAY**

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, what do you got for me?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Okay, so it's called Altered Carbon. It's a cyberpunk neo-noir detective story set in a future where consciousness can be digitized and transferred between bodies.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Woah woah woah. So, like... people don't actually die?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, yes and no! Their consciousness, or "DHF" - Digital Human Freight - is stored in a "cortical stack" in their spine. If their "sleeve" – their body – dies, they can just be "re-sleeved" into a new one.

**PRODUCER GUY:** But if they can just get a new body, then what's the stakes? Where's the danger?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Ah, that's where the *real* death comes in! If the stack is destroyed, then that's it. Permanent death. Unless, of course, you're super rich, and you can afford to back up your consciousness to a satellite every 48 hours.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, the rich people are *actually* immortal, and the poor people are still just, like, regular dead?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Pretty much! It's great social commentary. And our main character, Takeshi Kovacs, is a former elite soldier called an "Envoy" who was "put on stack" for centuries as punishment. He's then re-sleeved into a new body to solve the murder of one of these super-rich "Meths" – a guy named Laurens Bancroft, who mysteriously died, but has no memory of it because his stack was destroyed before his backup.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, he's a detective, solving a murder, but the victim is also the client?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly! It's very meta. And get this: the body Kovacs is re-sleeved into belonged to a cop who was dating the detective assigned to Bancroft's case!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, so he's dating the detective who's dating his own body? That's... unnecessarily complicated.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It adds layers! And then there are illegal "dual-sleeving" operations, where people illegally copy their stacks and control two bodies at once.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, someone could be, like, having dinner with you, but also simultaneously committing a crime across town?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Mind-blowing, right? And there's a hotel AI who embodies Edgar Allan Poe, and he's super polite. And a terrifying virtual reality torture chamber called Head in the Clouds where people's stacks are connected to machines that simulate endless pain and psychological torment.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wait, so people are tortured to death, but they don't *actually* die, they just experience it over and over again?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Only if their stack isn't destroyed! It's brutal, but it really highlights the themes of humanity and what it means to be alive when death isn't necessarily the end.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Okay, okay, I'm starting to get it. So, a lot of intense action, philosophical questions, and... a lot of nudity? I heard there's a lot of nudity.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, when bodies are just interchangeable "sleeves," the concept of modesty becomes... fluid. It's all very artistic and integral to the world-building!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Right, "artistic." So, we've got a dense, complex plot, a ton of exposition, gratuitous violence, and naked people.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** And a huge mystery at its core! Who killed Bancroft? And what's the connection to Kovacs' past and the mysterious Quellcrist Falconer, the leader of the Envoys who created the stack technology?

**PRODUCER GUY:** Okay, this sounds like it's going to be a huge hit. It's got everything the audience wants: high-concept sci-fi, a gritty detective story, and... *a lot* of skin. We'll make a fortune!
