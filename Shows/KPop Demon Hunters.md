**(SCENE START)**

**INT. PRODUCER'S OFFICE - DAY**

The PRODUCER GUY looks utterly baffled, a half-eaten bagel suspended in mid-air. The SCREENWRITER GUY is practically bouncing in his seat.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Alright, I'm gonna level with you. When your assistant said "K-Pop Demon Hunters," I thought it was some kind of elaborate prank. Is this... is this real?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Oh, it's very real, sir! And it's going to be huge! It's an animated feature film about a world-renowned K-Pop girl group, HUNTR/X, who are secretly demon hunters!

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, they sing catchy songs about, like, breaking up with your boyfriend, and then they grab a sword and, like, break up a demon's existence? That's super easy, barely an inconvenience.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly! Their voices actually help maintain a magical barrier, the Honmoon, that keeps demons from the human world! So, their music isn't just for entertainment, it's literally saving humanity!

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, if they have a bad vocal day, the world ends? That's a lot of pressure on a vocal cord. And what kind of demons are we talking about here? Are they, like, little imp-y things? Or big, scary, "rip your soul out" kind of demons?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Oh, the "rip your soul out" kind! Led by the terrifying Gwi-Ma! And get this, his latest plan is to send a *rival K-Pop boy band* into the human world to drain the energy of their fans and weaken the Honmoon!

**PRODUCER GUY:** A rival boy band of demons. So, they're, like, singing about love and heartbreak, but secretly they're just... consuming souls? That's actually pretty brilliant. Very meta. So, the audience is rooting for the girl group, right? Because they're the good guys?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, mostly! Our lead, Rumi, is actually half-demon herself, a secret she's kept from her bandmates, Mira and Zoey! And the leader of the demon boy band, Jinu, has his own complicated backstory!

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, one of our heroes is a demon, and one of the villains is, like, a sympathetic demon? Are we sure we know who to root for here? Because that's getting into a lot of "shades of grey" territory, and frankly, people just want to see cool dance moves and demons getting vanquished.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** But it adds emotional depth! It's about self-acceptance, and the nature of good and evil, and the power of music to overcome darkness!

**PRODUCER GUY:** "Power of music to overcome darkness." So, like, a really killer bass drop can banish a demon? Is that how this works?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** In a way, yes! Their synchronized choreography also plays a big part in their combat! It's a blend of high-energy K-Pop performances and intense martial arts!

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, like, a dance-off... to the death? That's fantastic! And what about the visual style? Is it, like, super vibrant and colorful, like a K-Pop music video?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Absolutely! It's incredibly animated, with a unique blend of Korean culture and a sort of anime-inspired action. It's going to pop off the screen!

**PRODUCER GUY:** And the music itself? Is it, you know, actually *good* K-Pop? Because if the songs aren't bops, this whole thing falls apart faster than a poorly choreographed dance routine.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** We've got original songs from top K-Pop producers, and even members of TWICE are involved! The music is going to be incredibly catchy and integral to the story!

**PRODUCER GUY:** TWICE, you say? Alright, now you're speaking my language. So, it's an action-comedy, with a lot of heart and some serious bangers?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** And it's a family film! It's for everyone!

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, kids will be humming about demon slaying on the way to school? That's... a choice. Alright, *KPop Demon Hunters*. I gotta admit, it's certainly unique. Just make sure the demons can really dance. We need some good rival group choreography.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Oh, they can dance, sir. They can *really* dance.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Super. Now, if you'll excuse me, I think I need to go listen to some K-Pop. Just to, you know, "research."
