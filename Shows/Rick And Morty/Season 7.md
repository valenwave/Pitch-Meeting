**INT. ADULT SWIM CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY**

PRODUCER GUY is wearing a "Morty's Mind Blowers" t-shirt, looking slightly disheveled but still riding the wave of success. SCREENWRITER GUY looks like he's aged five years in one, clutching a comfort blanket patterned with portal fluid.

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
Alright, Season 7! The big one! The one where we finally… well, you'll see. We're picking up right where we left off, with Rick laser-focused on finding Rick Prime.

**PRODUCER GUY**
(Eyes gleaming)
The ultimate hunt! The long-awaited payoff! This is what the fans want! Does he find him immediately? Is it an epic showdown in the first episode?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
(Shakes head slowly)
Not exactly. Rick's still obsessed, but he keeps getting sidetracked by more mundane problems. Like, in the first episode, he's trying to make a perfectly golden pancake, and it nearly destroys the universe.

**PRODUCER GUY**
A pancake. So, the fate of the multiverse hinges on breakfast. I love it! That's the *Rick and Morty* I know and sometimes question. Does he eventually get to hunting Rick Prime?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
He does! But it's interspersed with a lot of… domesticity. Like, in one episode, Rick and Morty have to go on a "revenge quest" for Summer, and it's mostly just them killing people who were mean to her.

**PRODUCER GUY**
So, Rick, the genius who just destroyed the Central Finite Curve, is now just a cosmic hitman for his granddaughter's petty grievances? That’s wonderfully anti-climactic. What else are we giving the fans? Any new recurring characters?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
We introduce "Crocubot"! He's a robot crocodile who’s part of a crew they assemble. And there's "Gene," a suburban guy whose son gets accidentally sent to another dimension.

**PRODUCER GUY**
A robot crocodile. And a normal dad whose kid is gone. So, we're broadening the scope. Are we still playing with the "two Beths" concept?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
Absolutely! In one episode, Space Beth discovers a massive conspiracy involving the Galactic Federation and a black market of planets that are just… sentient. And they have to team up to stop it.

**PRODUCER GUY**
So Space Beth gets her own spin-off adventure, kind of. I like it. Does it reinforce that they're both equally Beth?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
It does! It shows their unique strengths. And then we have an episode where Rick is constantly trying to replace Morty with other "Mortys," like a tough, experienced Rick named "Ice-T" who turns out to be a sentient letter.

**PRODUCER GUY**
(Stares blankly)
Ice-T. The rapper. Is a sentient letter. That's… a choice. Does Morty feel replaced? Is it another layer of his trauma?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
Oh, he feels it! It's very much about Rick's inability to commit to Morty, even when he claims he needs him. But then, the big one. The episode everyone's been waiting for. Rick finally catches up to **Rick Prime**.

**PRODUCER GUY**
(Leans forward, eyes wide)
Tell me. How does it happen? Is it a brutal, drawn-out battle? A cosmic chess match?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
It’s… both. Rick, Morty, and an even angrier version of Birdperson track him down. They confront him in a hidden lab. Rick Prime reveals that he's completely indifferent to Rick, that Rick's entire life has been about chasing something that means nothing to him.

**PRODUCER GUY**
(Nods slowly)
So, the ultimate villain is… utterly apathetic. That's a good twist. It makes Rick's revenge feel hollow, even as he gets it. Does Rick kill him?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
Rick brutally beats him to death. He dismantles him piece by piece. It's violent, it's visceral, and it's deeply unsatisfying for Rick. He gets his revenge, but it doesn't bring back Diane or Beth.

**PRODUCER GUY**
(A long, thoughtful pause. He puts down the foam finger.)
So, the entire driving force of Rick's character, his all-consuming quest for vengeance, comes to an end, and it leaves him empty. That's… surprisingly dark for a climax. How does Morty react?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
Morty is there. He witnesses it all. And he sees Rick still broken, even after getting his revenge. It's a huge moment for their relationship. It shows Morty truly understanding the depths of Rick's pain.

**PRODUCER GUY**
(Sighs)
And after that? What's left for Rick? For the show?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
The rest of the season is about them trying to figure that out. Rick starts trying to live a more "normal" life, or at least his version of it. He helps Gene find his son, he goes on more random adventures with the family. He's looking for a new purpose.

**PRODUCER GUY**
So, the big bad is gone, the portal gun is still broken from the Season 5 finale, and Rick is… trying to be a better person? This is a huge shift. Are the fans going to accept a "well-adjusted" Rick?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
He's not *well-adjusted*. He's just… searching. And the season finale has the family dealing with a giant turkey that threatens Thanksgiving, a classic *Rick and Morty* absurd premise after all the heavy stuff.

**PRODUCER GUY**
(Cracks a small smile)
A giant Thanksgiving turkey. So, back to basics, in a way. You know, you really gave the fans what they wanted with the Rick Prime payoff, but you also completely subverted their expectations by making it a hollow victory. That’s… genius. And painful. But mostly genius.

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
(Manic grin)
That's the point, sir! We give them the candy, then we show them the empty wrapper.

**PRODUCER GUY**
(Nods slowly, rubbing his chin)
Right. So, Rick Prime is gone. Rick's portal gun is still kaput. The multiverse is truly infinite. What's next for Season 8? A new villain? Does Rick find inner peace?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
(His eyes gleam with a disturbing light)
Inner peace? Oh, no, sir. But there *is* a giant talking cat that's probably from Florida... and it has a plan...

**PRODUCER GUY**
(Sighs, but there's a glint of excitement in his eyes)
Not the cat again... Just... write it down. All of it.
