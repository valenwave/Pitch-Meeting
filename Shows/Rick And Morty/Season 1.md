**INT. ADULT SWIM CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY**

PRODUCER GUY, sharp-suited and perpetually unimpressed, sips from a ridiculously oversized coffee mug. SCREENWRITER GUY, fidgety and earnest, is pacing.

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
Alright, so we've got this idea for a new animated show. It's called *Rick and Morty*.

**PRODUCER GUY**
*Rick and Morty*. Is it a buddy cop thing? Like, one's a cop, one's a guy who plays by his own rules?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
Uh, not exactly. It's about a super genius, alcoholic, nihilistic mad scientist named Rick, and his easily distressed, kind of dumb grandson, Morty.

**PRODUCER GUY**
Okay, so Doc Brown and Marty McFly, but Doc Brown is constantly drunk and tells Marty to stick things up his butt.

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
(Eyes wide)
...Yes! Exactly! But also, the multiverse is real. And they go to, like, all of it.

**PRODUCER GUY**
The *entire* multiverse? Isn't that… a lot of places?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
It’s infinite! And they're going to, you know, go on adventures. Like, they'll go to a dimension where the trees have giant seeds that give you temporary super intelligence, but you have to smuggle them… internally.

**PRODUCER GUY**
Internally. As in…

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
Yes. And then they'll get into, like, a shoot-out with insect aliens. And Morty gets all smart for a bit.

**PRODUCER GUY**
So, a kid puts giant seeds in his butt, gets smart, and then shoots aliens. This sounds… family-friendly.

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
It's for Adult Swim! It's going to be dark! And philosophical! Like, one episode, Rick gives their dog, Snuffles, a helmet that makes him super intelligent, and then Snuffles leads a dog uprising.

**PRODUCER GUY**
A dog uprising. With intelligent dogs. Do they… talk?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
Oh yeah, they talk. And they build mechanical suits. And they enslave humanity. It gets pretty intense.

**PRODUCER GUY**
Right. So we’re gonna have, like, a cute little dog, then he gets smart and suddenly he’s leading a canine revolution? This is going to confuse the audience. They're going to be like, "I thought this was a silly cartoon about a boy and his grandpa, now I'm watching dogs take over the world!"

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
But that’s the point! We subvert expectations! Like, another episode, Rick creates a love potion for Morty, but it goes wrong, and then everyone on Earth turns into mutated monsters!

**PRODUCER GUY**
(Spits out coffee)
Everyone? The whole planet?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
The *entire* planet. They turn into "Cronenbergs," like from those body horror movies. And then Rick and Morty have to abandon that reality and find a new one where they just… replace the Rick and Morty who died there. And then Morty has to bury his own dead body in the backyard.

**PRODUCER GUY**
(Stares blankly)
He… buries his own dead body. In the backyard. Of the house he just moved into. Because he destroyed his old universe.

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
It’s *groundbreaking*! It's dark, but it's funny! And it establishes that the consequences are real! Like, you can't just hit a reset button every episode. Except sometimes you can, but it’s still messed up!

**PRODUCER GUY**
So we're going to confuse the audience, traumatize a cartoon child, and constantly threaten the existence of Earth. And also, there's going to be an episode where they watch TV from other dimensions, and it's all improvised and weird.

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
Yes! Like, a commercial for "Real Fake Doors!" Or a show called "Ball Fondlers!" It'll be hilarious!

**PRODUCER GUY**
"Ball Fondlers." Got it. And the family? The normal family members? What are they doing while Rick is turning the planet into goo monsters and Morty is burying his corpse?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
Oh, Beth and Jerry, Morty's parents, they're constantly fighting. And Summer, Morty's sister, she's like a typical teenager, but she gets dragged into it sometimes too. Like, they get a "Meeseeks Box" and these blue creatures pop out and fulfill requests, and then explode. And Jerry just makes them do insane, impossible things.

**PRODUCER GUY**
So the entire show is just… chaos. And sadness. With some jokes about butts.

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
And it’s going to be wildly popular! Critics are going to love it! They’ll call it original and creative and praise the writing!

**PRODUCER GUY**
(Raises an eyebrow)
Right. Because nothing screams "critical acclaim" like interdimensional cable and burying yourself. Well, I guess we’re greenlighting this. But if people start demanding Szechuan sauce, that’s on you.

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
(Grinning)
Wubba lubba dub dub!

**PRODUCER GUY**
(Sighs, rubs temples)
What does that even mean? Is that a catchphrase?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
It means… I’m in great pain.

**PRODUCER GUY**
(Nods slowly)
Yeah. I’m starting to get that feeling.
