**INT. ADULT SWIM CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY**

PRODUCER GUY is wearing a "Got Rick Prime?" shirt, looking slightly less stressed than usual, but still with that glint of chaotic amusement in his eyes. SCREENWRITER GUY is practically vibrating with nervous energy, clutching a well-worn copy of a philosophy textbook.

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
Alright, Season 8! We killed Rick Prime! Rick's finally gotten his revenge, and... it feels pretty hollow, right? So, what's next for the smartest man in the multiverse who's no longer the smartest man in *every* multiverse, and still can't portal jump at will?

**PRODUCER GUY**
(Nodding slowly)
A vacuum. A profound, existential vacuum. I like it! How do we fill that void? More self-discovery? More accidental godhood?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
All of it! We open with Rick trying to find a new portal fluid. He tries everything – interdimensional dating apps, black market deals, even trying to siphon energy from a collapsing star. Nothing works reliably. He's effectively grounded.

**PRODUCER GUY**
(Chuckles)
So, Rick, the guy who could go anywhere, is now stuck. That's a good humble pie, or, you know, space humble pie. How does he cope with being a mere mortal, relatively speaking?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
He doesn't cope well. He gets incredibly bored and starts focusing on bizarre, hyper-specific inventions. Like, he builds a device that can perfectly perfectly toast bread based on the subject's deepest fears. Or a universal remote that controls... everything in the house, including Beth's emotions.

**PRODUCER GUY**
(Eyes wide)
A fear-toasting bread device? And an emotion-controlling remote? Oh, that last one is going to cause some problems with Beth. Is she still figuring out the two-Beth situation?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
Beth and Space Beth are still very much a thing, and they're trying to figure out their dynamic as a couple. One episode sees them accidentally getting involved in a cosmic divorce court, where they have to defend a planet's right to secede from a sentient star system.

**PRODUCER GUY**
A cosmic divorce court. And it's handled by Beths. I see the commentary there. What about Jerry? Has he finally found some self-respect, or is he still just Jerry?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
Jerry actually tries to get a job at a *Rick and Morty*-themed restaurant. He thinks he's perfect for it, but he's too pathetic even for *that*. He gets hired, but only as the mascot, and ends up in a bizarre turf war with other themed restaurant mascots.

**PRODUCER GUY**
(Laughs heartily)
Jerry, the mascot, in a gang war. That's *peak* Jerry. Does Morty finally get to be the hero, now that Rick is depowered, so to speak?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
Morty definitely steps up. He's more confident, more decisive. He leads an adventure where they have to infiltrate a dimension run by giant, sentient, judgmental eyeballs that consume people's insecurities. Morty has to overcome his own hang-ups to win.

**PRODUCER GUY**
So, a coming-of-age story for Morty, but with giant, insecure-eating eyeballs. Perfect. And the big bad for the season? Is there a new overarching threat, now that Rick Prime is gone?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
There is. We introduce a new antagonist: **The Collector**. He's an interdimensional hoarder, who collects unique individuals and objects from across the multiverse. He's been observing Rick for years, and now that the Central Finite Curve is down, he sees Rick and his unique family as the ultimate prize.

**PRODUCER GUY**
(Leans forward, intrigued)
The Collector. So, not a revenge villain, but a fan. That's a creepy new angle. Does he manage to capture anyone?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
He captures Summer! He sees her as the "ideal teenage girl specimen" for his collection. This forces Rick to really step up, but he can't just portal in and out. He has to rely on his wits, and on the family. It pushes him to truly collaborate with Morty, Beth, and Space Beth.

**PRODUCER GUY**
So, Rick's forced to work with his family to save Summer, without his usual cheats. That's great! It's a real test of his growth post-Rick Prime. How does the season finale play out?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
The finale is a desperate, multi-episode assault on The Collector's impossible fortress, which is made up of captured pieces of other dimensions. The family has to navigate different realities to find Summer. Rick eventually uses the last of his salvaged portal fluid, not to escape, but to give Morty a clear shot at The Collector.

**PRODUCER GUY**
(Nods slowly, absorbing this)
Morty gets the kill shot. After all this time, Morty saves the day. And Rick uses his last bit of portal fluid to enable it. So, Rick's self-sacrificing, and Morty is the hero. This is… surprisingly wholesome for us.

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
It's about evolution! Rick realizes his strength isn't just in his intelligence or his tech, but in his family. And Morty finally gets to be the competent, capable hero he's been growing into. They defeat The Collector, save Summer, but they're still stuck without reliable portal travel.

**PRODUCER GUY**
(Lets out a slow exhale, a satisfied smile spreading across his face)
So, we tie up the Rick Prime arc, introduce a new existential threat that forces Rick to grow, give Morty a true hero moment, and we still leave them grounded. The stakes feel real now. The possibilities… are truly infinite, even without the portal gun. This is fantastic. Absolutely fantastic.

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
(Adjusts his glasses, a glint in his eye)
And remember that talking cat that's probably from Florida?

**PRODUCER GUY**
(Snaps his fingers)
The cat! Yes! Is he The Collector? Is he involved?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
He makes a post-credits appearance. Sitting in a dark room, stroking a small, glowing orb. He whispers, "Phase one complete. Now, for the real fun."

**PRODUCER GUY**
(Leaps up, pumping his fist)
A new, even deeper conspiracy! And it's the cat! You sick genius! This sets up Season 9 beautifully! What are we calling him? The Florida Cat?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
(Smiling faintly)
Just... **The Cat**.

**PRODUCER GUY**
(Slaps the table)
The Cat! I love it! Let's get to work!
