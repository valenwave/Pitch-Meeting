**INT. ADULT SWIM CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY**

PRODUCER GUY is wearing a "Pickle Rick" baseball cap and juggling three Szechuan sauce packets. SCREENWRITER GUY looks like he hasn't slept since Season 3, his eyes wide and bloodshot.

**PRODUCER GUY**
Season 4, baby! The people are hungry for it! The internet wants more! We established Rick's vulnerable side, we offed Jerry (briefly), and we got that sweet, sweet Szechuan sauce buzz! What's next on the menu of existential despair and sci-fi nonsense?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
(Voice hoarse)
Okay, so the premiere! Rick takes Morty to a planet to get death crystals, which show you all your possible futures and how you die. Morty grabs one, sees a future where he dies old with Jessica, and starts trying to force that future, no matter what.

**PRODUCER GUY**
So Morty's, like, living his life according to a crystal ball? That's a good commentary on destiny versus free will, or something. Does it go horribly wrong?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
Oh, it goes *horribly* wrong! He accidentally kills Rick, then refuses to clone him back because it doesn't align with the crystal's vision! Rick's consciousness ends up in fascist alternate Ricks and a Wasp Rick! And Morty goes full-on cyborg abomination to achieve his Jessica future!

**PRODUCER GUY**
(Nods approvingly)
Cyborg abomination for love. Classic. And a Wasp Rick? Is he, like, a tiny Rick? Or a regular Rick who's just really angry?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
He's a regular Rick, but he's a wasp. And he helps! It's a whole thing. Then, Glootie, an alien with a giant "Do Not Develop My App" tattoo on his forehead, creates a dating app called "Lovefinderrz" that Jerry names.

**PRODUCER GUY**
An app created by an alien explicitly *not* to be an app. And Jerry names it. This sounds like prime Jerry content. Does it destroy humanity?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
It nearly does! Glootie's species planned to use the app to distract humans while they stole all of Earth's water! But Jerry, in his bumbling way, helps stop it!

**PRODUCER GUY**
Jerry saves the world. Wow. That's a new one. What about Rick's bizarre personal life? Does he find love? Or, you know, a new toilet?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
He finds a private toilet! He tracks down another "shy pooper," an alien named Tony. They bond over their shared need for private bathroom experiences.

**PRODUCER GUY**
So, a whole episode about a secret toilet. And a bond forged over fecal privacy. This show continues to push boundaries. Is there a heist episode? Because after the Szechuan sauce, people expect heists.

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
There's a *meta-heist* episode! Rick out-heists a famous alien heist artist named Miles Knightly, then builds a "Heist-o-Tron" that goes rogue and tries to steal planets! Rick has to build a "Rand-o-Tron" to beat it! And it's all just Rick manipulating Morty to stop him from going into screenwriting for Netflix!

**PRODUCER GUY**
(A beat)
So the entire, elaborate, reality-bending heist was just to stop Morty from pitching a show to Netflix? And we're, like, explicitly calling out Netflix?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
It’s a commentary on the creative process! And it's hilarious! Morty gives up his screenplay! Rick wins!

**PRODUCER GUY**
Right. And Morty gets a dragon, I hear? Because dragons are cool. Everyone loves dragons.

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
Morty gets a dragon! Balthromaw! But it turns out dragons are actually… sexual deviants who "soul bond" with people and just want to participate in orgies. And then Jerry gets involved with a talking cat who may or may not be from Florida.

**PRODUCER GUY**
So, dragons are sex fiends, and a talking cat from Florida. Is the cat evil? Is the cat, like, a Lovecraftian horror?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
We never find out! Rick warns Jerry not to ask about the cat's origins, and when Jerry pushes it, Rick shows him something that makes Jerry vomit profusely. It's left to the imagination!

**PRODUCER GUY**
(Shudders)
Okay, so the cat is probably worse than Cronenbergs. Noted. And then the finale! What fresh hell are we unleashing on the audience?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
The Beth clone! She comes back! And we get Space Beth! It's revealed Rick made two Beths, and even *he* doesn't know which is the original and which is the clone because he scrambled his own memories!

**PRODUCER GUY**
So there are two Beths now? And neither of them, nor Rick, knows who the "real" Beth is? This is going to send the theorists into a frenzy! Does the family accept two Beths?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
They kind of have to! And then Tammy and Phoenixperson attack! Birdperson, revived as a cyborg weapon by the Federation, comes back to fight Rick!

**PRODUCER GUY**
(Eyes wide)
Phoenixperson! So Birdperson is back, but as a robot warrior! And he tries to kill Rick, his best friend, at his own daughter's house! This is amazing!

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
It's a huge battle! The two Beths fight alongside each other! Rick defeats Phoenixperson, but spares him. And the family accepts both Beths! But it all reinforces that Rick is a manipulative liar, even to himself, and the family is starting to see through it.

**PRODUCER GUY**
So, Rick's in space jail, Rick escapes, Rick gets rid of Jerry, Rick becomes a pickle, Rick hides his toilet, Rick orchestrates a meta-heist, Rick deals with sex dragons, Rick brings back Beth's clone and it's a huge fight, and Rick still can't admit he loves his family.

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
Exactly! It's a deconstruction of Rick's character! He's powerful, but also deeply flawed and increasingly losing control over his own family's perceptions of him.

**PRODUCER GUY**
(A long, thoughtful pause. He takes off his Pickle Rick hat.)
You know, I thought Season 3 was peak nihilism. But Season 4… Season 4 really dug into the emotional wreckage. And the Szechuan sauce worked. So… you win again, you magnificent bastard. Just… try to get some sleep before Season 5, okay?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
(Muttering, already scribbling in a notebook)
More clones… angry squirrels… a musical…

**PRODUCER GUY**
(Sighs)
Just go.
