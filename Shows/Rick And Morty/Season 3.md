**INT. ADULT SWIM CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY**

PRODUCER GUY is wearing a "Wubba Lubba Dub Dub" t-shirt, clearly riding high on Season 2's success. SCREENWRITER GUY looks even more sleep-deprived, nursing a fourth cup of coffee.

**PRODUCER GUY**
Alright, Season 3! The people are *clamoring* for it! The Szechuan sauce memes are flying! The internet is broken! What do you have for me, you beautiful, messed-up genius?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
Okay, so we left Rick in galactic prison, right? And the Federation has taken over Earth.

**PRODUCER GUY**
Yeah, yeah, high stakes, emotional cliffhanger. How do we resolve it? Does Morty rally the troops? Does Summer get super-powered?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
Rick escapes. By himself. He completely dismantles the Federation and their economy, pretty much single-handedly. And it's all part of a master plan to get rid of Jerry.

**PRODUCER GUY**
(Spits out coffee)
To get *rid* of Jerry? The entire galactic government collapsed because Rick wanted to break up Beth and Jerry?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
Yep! And he succeeds! Beth and Jerry get divorced! It's a huge shift in the family dynamic.

**PRODUCER GUY**
So, we finally get rid of Jerry. Good. He was... a lot. So, what adventures are they going on now? More dimensions? More existential crises?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
We go to a post-apocalyptic *Mad Max*-style world where Summer falls in love with a Death Stalker, Morty gets a giant arm that wants revenge, and Rick just wants some Isotope 322.

**PRODUCER GUY**
A giant revenge arm. And Summer's in love with a guy in a spiked helmet. This is… surprisingly wholesome for a *Mad Max* world. And then there's the big one.

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
Ah, yes. "Pickle Rick."

**PRODUCER GUY**
Tell me about "Pickle Rick." The internet went wild for "Pickle Rick." How did we even come up with "Pickle Rick"?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
Well, Rick turns himself into a pickle to avoid family therapy. And then he falls into a sewer, builds a rat-powered exoskeleton, and battles Russian mobsters and a super-assassin named Jaguar. All while being a pickle.

**PRODUCER GUY**
He's a pickle. With a rat exoskeleton. Fighting *Russian mobsters*. This is art. Pure, unadulterated art. Does he eventually go to therapy?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
He does! And the therapist, Dr. Wong, completely dismantles him psychologically. It's beautiful.

**PRODUCER GUY**
So we have a sentient pickle fighting the Russian mafia, and then he gets therapy. And the Szechuan sauce? Where does that come in?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
At the very end of the premiere! Rick goes on this whole rant, saying his entire motivation for everything, for freeing himself and destroying the Federation, was to get his hands on McDonald's Szechuan sauce, a limited-time promotion from 1998 for the movie *Mulan*. He says he'll keep doing this for "nine more seasons, Morty!"

**PRODUCER GUY**
(Stares blankly)
He says... we're going to do this for *nine more seasons*? Just for a dipping sauce? People are going to take that seriously, you know. They're going to demand McDonald's bring back the sauce.

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
That's the plan! It's meta! It's commentary on fandom! It's hilarious!

**PRODUCER GUY**
(Shakes head)
You're a madman. A brilliant, brilliant madman. What else? Are we going to keep exploring the darker side of Rick?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
Definitely! We've got an episode where Rick and Morty try to "detoxify" themselves by removing their negative personality traits, which then create evil, toxic versions of themselves. And then they have to fight them.

**PRODUCER GUY**
So Rick literally has to fight his own toxic masculinity? And Morty fights his own insecurity? That's… oddly profound. What about the Citadel of Ricks? Is that still a thing after Rick blew it up?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
It is! We have a whole episode focused on the Citadel rebuilding, and a Morty actually gets elected President of the Citadel. It's a political satire.

**PRODUCER GUY**
A Morty is President? Is he… a good president?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
Well, it turns out he’s *Evil Morty*! The one from Season 1! He orchestrates everything to consolidate power and then vanishes. It sets up future seasons!

**PRODUCER GUY**
(Leans forward, intrigued)
Evil Morty! So, the bad guy from way back is still lurking! I like it! And the family? Are they still falling apart after the divorce?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
Beth has a big episode where she wonders if she's as messed up as Rick, and Rick offers to make her a clone to live out her fantasies while the clone stays with the family. And we never find out if she took him up on it!

**PRODUCER GUY**
So we're going to introduce a Beth clone and then leave it ambiguous? You really enjoy messing with people, don't you?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
It’s *art*, sir! And in the finale, Rick and the President of the United States get into a massive fight over a selfie.

**PRODUCER GUY**
A fight with the *President*? Over a *selfie*? And they destroy the White House?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
It’s epic! It’s ridiculous! It’s everything people love about the show! And it ends with the family mostly back together, but with Beth and Jerry still separated. And Rick has, you know, subtly reasserted his dominance.

**PRODUCER GUY**
(Sighs, shakes his head, but a smile plays on his lips)
You know, I keep thinking you've gone too far, and then you just go further. And people love it. It's like you're tapping into the collective id of the internet.

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
(Winks)
Nine more seasons, boss. Nine more seasons and that Szechuan sauce is ours.

**PRODUCER GUY**
(Muttering)
Oh God, he's serious about the sauce...
