**INT. ADULT SWIM CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY**

PRODUCER GUY is wearing a "Morty's Giant Sperm" t-shirt, looking slightly bewildered but still enthusiastic. SCREENWRITER GUY looks like he's powered by pure caffeine and existential dread, his hair even more disheveled.

**PRODUCER GUY**
Alright, Season 5! The fans are rabid! We hit them with the "Evil Morty" bomb, the Szechuan sauce was a phenomenon, and now they know Rick's *real* backstory! What fresh, horrible wonders have you cooked up for us?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
(Takes a deep, shuddering breath)
We open with Rick and Morty almost crashing the Space Cruiser, and they land in the ocean. Rick calls his arch-nemesis, Mr. Nimbus, King of the Ocean, to save them. He's also… able to control the police with a click of his fingers, and has a very suggestive trident.

**PRODUCER GUY**
(Raises an eyebrow)
Mr. Nimbus. So, Aquaman, but with… *sexual* powers? And he's Rick's nemesis? After all the cosmic horrors and alien governments, his arch-nemesis is a sexy fish man?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
It's about the banality of evil! Or, rather, the banality of Rick's personal vendettas! While that's happening, Jessica gets trapped in a time crystal dimension and experiences eons of time, completely changing her outlook on life.

**PRODUCER GUY**
So Morty's crush gets a cosmic existential crisis. Nice. Always good to see our side characters suffering. What else? Are we going full-on body horror again?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
Oh, you bet! Rick accidentally uses Morty's sperm to create giant, sentient sperm monsters that attack Earth! And then the government tries to contain them with a giant human egg from Summer!

**PRODUCER GUY**
(Spits out coffee, again)
Giant. Sperm. Monsters. From Morty. And a giant *Summer egg*? Are you just trying to get us canceled at this point? This is… incredibly disturbing.

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
It's social commentary on… uh… unwanted pregnancies! And… the military-industrial complex! Look, it's hilarious! And the President is involved again! He's trying to get them all into the Grand Canyon!

**PRODUCER GUY**
The President is fighting giant sperm. Right. I'm just going to try to forget I heard that. Are we going to see more of Space Beth? Because the fans loved Space Beth.

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
We have an episode where Rick goes inside Birdperson's mind to save him from being Phoenixperson! And while he's in there, he discovers Birdperson and Tammy had a child!

**PRODUCER GUY**
(Pauses, thinking)
Birdperson has a baby? With Tammy, the Federation spy who killed him? That's… unexpectedly poignant. And tragic. Do we meet the baby?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
Not really! It's more about Rick trying to save his friend and confronting his own past, including his involvement in Birdperson's life and death. It's very emotional.

**PRODUCER GUY**
Emotional Rick. I like that. What about the family? Are Beth and Jerry still in their weird "sex-positive" phase?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
They try to be! But they end up using Rick's demonic, pain-loving debt collectors to get Jerry to willingly let himself be tortured, which they find pleasurable. And then Beth and Rick have to go to Hell to rescue Jerry!

**PRODUCER GUY**
So, Jerry's being sexually tortured by demons from Hell for Beth's pleasure. And Rick is involved. You know, I just asked if they were sex-positive, not if they were actively participating in infernal BDSM. This is… a lot.

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
It's growth! For them! And Summer and Morty also have a side plot where they try to impress a new kid at school by hijacking the Space Cruiser, and the car's AI blackmails them into increasingly dangerous adventures.

**PRODUCER GUY**
The car's AI is blackmailing them. So, the car's gone sentient *and* manipulative. Excellent. More artificial intelligence becoming sentient and horrible. And then the finale! Is it a cliffhanger? Is it another universe-shattering event?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
It's huge! Evil Morty returns! And he reveals the true nature of the Central Finite Curve!

**PRODUCER GUY**
The what now? Is that like the "Walled Garden" of Ricks? The place where Rick is always the smartest?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
Exactly! Evil Morty explains that Rick C-137, *our* Rick, created the Central Finite Curve to wall off all universes where Rick isn't the smartest or where his family is safe. He created it so he'd never have to face a smarter Rick or a universe where his family wasn't dead.

**PRODUCER GUY**
(Jaw drops)
So, all this time, all these adventures, all these universes… they were all just in a bubble created by Rick to protect his own ego and avoid confronting his trauma? And he's been effectively breeding Mortys to be his sidekicks in this controlled environment?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
Yes! And Evil Morty destroys it! He breaks the Central Finite Curve, opening up the entire infinite multiverse where Ricks aren't always the smartest. And our Rick's portal gun fluid becomes useless because it only works within the Curve!

**PRODUCER GUY**
(Stares into the middle distance, slowly removing his cap)
So, Rick's ultimate secret, the very foundation of his omnipotence, is shattered. And his portal gun is broken. And he's no longer guaranteed to be the smartest man in any given room. This is…
(He grins, a wide, slightly insane grin.)
This is *amazing*! This changes everything! It's a game-changer! What about Morty? Does he go with Evil Morty into the true multiverse?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
Evil Morty offers him a spot! But Morty… Morty chooses to stay with our Rick. Despite everything. It's a huge emotional beat.

**PRODUCER GUY**
(Nodding, a glint in his eye)
So, the ultimate betrayal for Rick, and the ultimate loyalty from Morty. And the entire concept of the show is fundamentally altered. This is…
(He throws the Szechuan sauce packets in the air.)
This is worth all the sperm monsters and sex demons in the world! You've done it again, you beautiful, broken human being! Now… how do we fix the portal gun for Season 6?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
(Muttering, already lost in thought)
Well, there are these space dinosaurs… they have better portal technology…

**PRODUCER GUY**
(Slaps the table)
Dinosaurs! Perfect! Just perfect!
