**INT. ADULT SWIM CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY**

PRODUCER GUY is leaning back, a satisfied smirk on his face. SCREENWRITER GUY looks a bit more haggard, clutching a new stack of papers.

**PRODUCER GUY**
Alright, so Season 1 was a hit! People loved the butt stuff, the Cronenbergs, the nihilism! It was a real… *Rick* roller coaster! Nailed it. So, what's Season 2 got for us? More interdimensional hijinks? More existential dread?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
Oh, absolutely! We're leaning into all of it. We open with Rick, Morty, and Summer having to fix the house after freezing time for six months, which, naturally, creates alternate timelines whenever they're uncertain about something.

**PRODUCER GUY**
So, they're literally splitting reality with their indecision? That's… aggressively on-brand. Do they, like, see themselves in other timelines? Do they fight themselves?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
They sure do! And a time-traveling, testicle-headed creature shows up to try and stop them, but they just break his collars and beat him up in 64 different timelines simultaneously!

**PRODUCER GUY**
(Nodding slowly)
Sixty-four different timelines beating up a testicle monster. You know, sometimes I worry you're just writing down my fever dreams. What else? Are we going to keep traumatizing Morty?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
Oh, always! In one episode, Rick takes Morty to an arcade, but Morty feels bad about leaving Jerry at a special "Jerry Daycare" – for Jerries from all the alternate realities – so he goes off to stop an assassin. And the assassin's target is a gaseous, telepathic being Rick nicknames "Fart."

**PRODUCER GUY**
A telepathic fart. That sings. Of course. And Jerry’s just… at daycare with a bunch of other Jerries? Do they, like, compare notes on how much Ricks ruin their lives?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
That’s basically the idea! Some of them have been abandoned there indefinitely! It’s really sad for Jerry, but hilarious for us. And Fart, the gaseous being, turns out to want to destroy all carbon-based life forms, so Morty has to kill him. After Fart sings a beautiful song.

**PRODUCER GUY**
(Pinching the bridge of his nose)
So Morty kills a singing fart. Right. And what about Rick's past? Are we going to hint at why he's such a… lovable garbage person?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
We're going to dive in a bit! Rick reconnects with an old flame, a hive mind named Unity. It's a huge, sprawling entity that assimilates entire planets.

**PRODUCER GUY**
A hive mind. So, like, a giant sentient blob that just absorbs everyone? Is it… sexy?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
It's complicated! Rick's clearly still in love with it, and it's with him, but it's ultimately destructive. And when Unity breaks up with Rick, he gets really, really depressed. Like, he tries to commit suicide in the garage.

**PRODUCER GUY**
(Spits out coffee)
He *what*?! We're going from singing farts and testicle monsters to attempted suicide? This is a cartoon! For adults, yes, but still!

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
It’s a powerful moment! It shows the depth of Rick’s pain! It's *nuance*! And then, we have an episode where alien parasites implant false memories in the family's minds, creating new characters they think are real.

**PRODUCER GUY**
So, like, an entirely new cast every five minutes? How do we know who's real? How do *they* know who’s real?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
That’s the twist! The parasites can only create positive memories, so the family has to find *negative* memories to prove someone's real. And then Beth accidentally shoots Mr. Poopybutthole, who turns out to have been real all along!

**PRODUCER GUY**
Mr. Poopybutthole. He’s real? Did we establish him in Season 1? I don't remember a Mr. Poopybutthole.

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
Nope! He just… appeared! It's meta! It plays with the audience's expectations! And then in the finale, Rick and the family go to Birdperson's wedding.

**PRODUCER GUY**
Birdperson! I like Birdperson. He’s… a bird person. Simple, effective. Is the wedding nice? Is it a happy occasion?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
It’s a bloodbath! Birdperson’s bride, Tammy, reveals she’s a secret agent for the Galactic Federation, and it’s a trap! Birdperson dies! The Federation attacks!

**PRODUCER GUY**
(Stares into the middle distance)
So, the bird person gets married, and then he dies. At his own wedding. Because his wife was a spy. This is… a lot.

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
And Rick has to get the family away from the Federation, but they can't go back to Earth, so they're on the run. And then Rick overhears Jerry suggesting they turn him in, so he sacrifices himself and gets captured by the Federation to save his family.

**PRODUCER GUY**
(Eyes wide)
Rick. Sacrifices. Himself. The nihilistic, drunk, doesn't-care-about-anyone Rick. He goes to space prison. For his family.

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
It's a huge emotional moment! It completely upends the status quo for Season 3! It shows Rick actually *cares*!

**PRODUCER GUY**
(Long pause. Takes a huge gulp of coffee.)
So, to recap: we had 64 timelines, a singing fart, a suicidal Rick, a real Mr. Poopybutthole, and a wedding massacre that ends with Rick in space jail.

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
And it’s all connected! There are recurring themes of family, love, the meaning of existence, and the crushing weight of infinite possibilities!

**PRODUCER GUY**
(Sighs)
You know, I’m starting to think you just write down every dark, bizarre thought that pops into your head and then connect it with, like, a single sentence of justification.

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
(Grinning maniacally)
You're not wrong, sir! You're not wrong.
