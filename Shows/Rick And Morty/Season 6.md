**INT. ADULT SWIM CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY**

PRODUCER GUY is wearing a "Wubba Lubba Dub Dub" foam finger and looks almost… calm. SCREENWRITER GUY, however, looks like he's been through a cosmic meat grinder, clutching a therapy puppet.

**PRODUCER GUY**
Alright, Season 6! The Central Finite Curve is shattered! Rick's portal gun is broken! The multiverse is truly infinite now! This is HUGE! So, how do we capitalize on this paradigm shift, huh? More of that deep, serialized storytelling? Or do we pivot back to some classic, self-contained madness?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
(Eyes darting nervously)
Both! We open with Rick trying to fix the portal gun, but he accidentally resets everyone who's traveled interdimensionally back to their original dimension!

**PRODUCER GUY**
(Eyes widen)
So, Morty goes back to Cronenberg World?! And Jerry swaps with the Jerry from the "Mortynight Run" universe? This is fantastic! A direct consequence of the finale! Does Rick go back to his universe where Diane and Beth died?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
He does! And he finds an AI version of Diane he programmed to haunt him! But then he learns that *Rick Prime*, the Rick who killed his family, was also sent back to his original dimension by the reset!

**PRODUCER GUY**
Rick Prime! The ultimate villain! So, we're finally getting the big showdown? The years-long hunt for revenge is back on?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
Yes! But then Morty convinces Rick to prioritize saving the rest of the family first, who are scattered across various dimensions. So they have to go rescue Cronenberg Jerry and the rest!

**PRODUCER GUY**
(Nods)
Good, good. Family first. But the hunt for Rick Prime is still looming, right? Like a constant threat?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
Oh, it's the season's overarching narrative! Rick is obsessed! He's got a whole "Rick Prime hunting rig" in the garage. But it's also about him trying to be a better person, trying to be there for his family, despite his rage.

**PRODUCER GUY**
So, Rick's trying to grow, but he's also consumed by vengeance. That's some good character work! What about Beth and Space Beth? Are they still co-existing?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
They are! And they're actually exploring their romantic feelings for each other! They have a whole episode where they bond over Venusian wine and end up in a "San Junipero"-esque holodeck romance!

**PRODUCER GUY**
(Leaning forward, intrigued)
Beth and Space Beth are… dating? So, self-love, literally. That's… bold. Does Rick approve?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
He does, begrudgingly! He even says he's "been there." It's surprisingly wholesome, in a weird, incestuous-but-not way. And then, we introduce the concept of "Night Persons!"

**PRODUCER GUY**
Night Persons? Is that like night-shift workers? Or, like, literal people who only exist at night?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
Rick gets a device that lets him sleepwalk and create a "Night Person" to do chores he doesn't want to do. The whole family gets in on it, but then the Night Family becomes sentient and revolts, leading to a chaotic battle where they keep tranquilizing each other!

**PRODUCER GUY**
So, the domestic disputes escalate to a full-blown existential war between day selves and night selves. And it's all because Rick wouldn't rinse the dishes. Brilliant! What about Morty? Any more giant sperm?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
No more sperm, thankfully. But Morty gets stuck in the virtual reality game "Roy: A Life Well Lived" from Season 2, with his identity split among five billion NPCs! Rick has to go in and play as "Roy" to save him!

**PRODUCER GUY**
(Chuckles)
"Roy: A Life Well Lived" again! And Rick has to be the game's protagonist. That's a deep cut for the fans. Does Morty learn a valuable lesson about… living?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
He does! And then Rick gives him a lightsaber for Christmas, which Morty promptly drops, sending it burning towards the Earth's core, threatening to destroy the planet!

**PRODUCER GUY**
(Eyes wide)
A lightsaber! And it's a planet-destroying hazard! This sounds like a great way to end a season! Does the President get involved?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
Oh, the President is *furious*! He wants that lightsaber because he's a huge *Star Wars* fan. But the twist is, the Rick that Morty has been adventuring with for most of the season turns out to be a *robot* Rick, created by the real Rick so he could focus on hunting Rick Prime!

**PRODUCER GUY**
(Jumps up, ecstatic)
A robot Rick! So the emotional growth, the family bonding, the therapy sessions… it was all a robot! That's a classic misdirect! You magnificent bastards! And the real Rick?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
The real Rick is in the basement, obsessively hunting Rick Prime. The family kills the robot Rick, and then the real Rick emerges, telling Morty he's finally found a lead on Rick Prime!

**PRODUCER GUY**
(Pacing with excitement)
So, we end on the precipice of the ultimate showdown! The long-awaited revenge arc is finally in full swing! And Rick's character development… it was real, but also a carefully constructed facade! It's both serialized and episodic! It's *perfect*! How did you even come up with all this?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
(Sighs, looks at his therapy puppet)
Honestly, sir, sometimes I just stare at a wall until something breaks.

**PRODUCER GUY**
(Pats him on the back, almost knocking him over)
Well, keep staring, my friend! Keep staring! Because this is gold! Pure, unadulterated, deeply disturbed gold! Now, what about Season 7? Are we finally killing Rick Prime?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
(Muttering)
We're going to try… but there might be a new evil… a new threat… and maybe Rick gets a new portal gun, but it's *worse*…

**PRODUCER GUY**
(Beaming)
Worse! I love it! Let's get to work!
