PRODUCER GUY: So, what's the pitch?
SCREENWRITER GUY: Okay, so it's a show about a high-end chef. He works in these super fancy, Michelin-star restaurants, right? All that intense, screaming, perfectionist stuff.
PRODUCER GUY: Uh-huh. Sounds... stressful. And probably expensive to film. Lots of tiny, artfully arranged food that no one actually wants to eat.
SCREENWRITER GUY: Well, yes, but that's just the start. His brother, who owned a small Italian beef sandwich shop in Chicago, dies. By suicide.
PRODUCER GUY: Whoa. Okay. So, it's a gritty drama then? With sandwiches?
SCREENWRITER GUY: It’s… it’s a comedy-drama. A dramedy! He inherits the sandwich shop, and it’s a total disaster. The kitchen is grimy, the staff are unruly, his brother’s best friend is the de facto manager and a bit of a hothead…
PRODUCER GUY: So, a fish-out-of-water story, but the fish is a fancy chef and the water is greasy beef juice. Got it. What’s the hook? Is he trying to turn it into a Michelin-star sandwich shop? Because that sounds like a terrible idea.
SCREENWRITER GUY: He is trying to elevate it! He brings in a young, talented chef who wants to learn, and they try to implement fine dining practices in this chaotic, old-school place.
PRODUCER GUY: So, lots of shouting. And people calling each other "chef." Over and over again. And the camera just zips around, making everyone feel anxious?
SCREENWRITER GUY: It creates a sense of urgency! And the dialogue is really fast, overlapping! Like a real kitchen!
PRODUCER GUY: Right. So, you’re telling me people want to watch a show where they feel like they’re being yelled at while trying to figure out what everyone is saying, and it’s about making Italian beef sandwiches? And there's a lot of underlying grief and trauma from the brother who died by suicide?
SCREENWRITER GUY: Well, yes, but there's also an episode where they cater a kids' birthday party, and the Ecto Cooler gets accidentally spiked with Xanax.
PRODUCER GUY: Xanax-spiked Ecto Cooler for kids. In a dramedy about a grieving chef and his chaotic sandwich shop. That sounds... like a choice. What about the money? Does the brother just leave him a pile of debt?
SCREENWRITER GUY: He leaves a ton of debt. And then they find a bunch of cash hidden inside giant cans of crushed tomatoes.
PRODUCER GUY: He hid cash in tomato cans? Why? Was he trying to make some kind of bizarre, edible safe? And how did they even find it? Did they just decide to open every single can? That’s a lot of tomato paste.
SCREENWRITER GUY: It was a recipe for spaghetti! The money was taped to the bottom of the cans the recipe called for! And they were already using those same cans, so they just stumbled upon it! It was foreshadowed earlier!
PRODUCER GUY: So, his dead brother left him a treasure map in a spaghetti recipe, and the treasure was just... in the cans they were already using. That’s a very specific kind of scavenger hunt. So, what, the show is just about them trying to open a new, fancier restaurant now that they have tomato can money?
SCREENWRITER GUY: Well, they're working towards that! And there are lots of intense, long takes. And one episode is almost entirely one continuous shot in real-time, with everyone screaming at each other!
PRODUCER GUY: So, we're making people stressed. Again. And then at the end, it turns out the restaurant isn't doing as well as they thought, and there's a critical review that says it's pretentious.
SCREENWRITER GUY: It’s about the journey! The character development! The exploration of family trauma and mental health through the lens of a high-stress kitchen environment!
PRODUCER GUY: You know what? It's so utterly bizarre, it just might work. People love to feel stressed out by TV shows, right?
