**Producer Guy:** Season 2 was... well, it was something. People definitely talked about it. Especially the part with the baby. So, what's the grand finale? Season 3, baby! Lay it on me.

**Screenwriter Guy:** Okay, so we pick up right after Season 2. Gi-hun, he's back. He's not touching the money. He's full of survivor's guilt, right? And he's got one goal: end the games. He decides the only way to do that is to go back *into* the games.

**Producer Guy:** Wait, Gi-hun dies at the end of Season 2! He sacrifices himself for the baby! I thought that was the big emotional climax!

**Screenwriter Guy:** Oh, that was just a misdirect, a metaphorical death! He *almost* died, but then he's back, more determined than ever. He believes if he re-enters, Jun-ho, the cop brother, can track him and finally expose the whole operation.

**Producer Guy:** Jun-ho! The guy who got shot off a cliff in Season 1, and then magically survived Season 2? He's still around? Is he just made of plot armor?

**Screenwriter Guy:** He's dedicated, sir! He's found a way to track the island. So now he's working with some new allies, like Player 246, who also escaped. It's a proper police procedural, but with more deadly children's games.

**Producer Guy:** So, Gi-hun goes back in. What's his player number now? Is he still 456? Because that's iconic.

**Screenwriter Guy:** Absolutely! Still 456. But he's not the same Gi-hun. He's driven by vengeance. He even kills another player, Dae-ho, who he blames for a failed rebellion from Season 2. It's dark, sir. Very dark.

**Producer Guy:** Oh, Gi-hun's gone dark! I like it! Audiences love a good anti-hero. So, what are the games this season? Something even more twisted, I hope.

**Screenwriter Guy:** You got it. We've got a brutal game of hide-and-seek where the "seekers" are armed with knives. And a "Jump Rope" game where players have to time their movements across a bridge while a giant jump rope swings at them, but the real danger comes from other players pushing people off.

**Producer Guy:** Pushing people off a jump rope bridge! Brilliant! So, is the Front Man still going undercover as Player 001? Because that was a whole thing.

**Screenwriter Guy:** No, the Front Man is back as the Front Man. But he reveals his identity to Gi-hun! He wants to break Gi-hun, to prove that humanity isn't worth saving. He even tries to get Gi-hun to kill the other contestants in their sleep, just like he did to win *his* game.

**Producer Guy:** So the Front Man won his game by murdering sleeping people? That's... extreme. I love it! And then what's the big grand finale game?

**Screenwriter Guy:** It's "Game of Towers." Players have to navigate three massive stone towers, and to progress, they have to kill another player. The surviving players split the money evenly.

**Producer Guy:** Evenly? So, if only two people survive, they each get half? That's genius! It really makes them turn on each other. So, who makes it to the end? Gi-hun and the baby? Because the baby won Season 2, remember?

**Screenwriter Guy:** Well, the baby is still a player, Player 222, and Gi-hun is trying to protect it. But then Myung-gi, the baby's actual father and the crypto influencer from Season 2, tries to push another player off so he can get more money! And then he fights Gi-hun, and Gi-hun... sacrifices himself. For real this time.

**Producer Guy:** Gi-hun dies *again*?! But this time for real? Are we sure about that? He's our main character!

**Screenwriter Guy:** It's the ultimate sacrifice, sir! He chooses humanity over money. It profoundly affects the Front Man, who realizes Gi-hun proved him wrong. And as Gi-hun dies, Jun-ho arrives with the Coast Guard and the whole facility blows up!

**Producer Guy:** So Gi-hun dies, the facility blows up, Jun-ho finally gets his revenge... and the baby wins again?

**Screenwriter Guy:** No, not exactly. The baby is left in Jun-ho's care. It's a new beginning! And then, we have a cameo in the final moments: Cate Blanchett! She's recruiting potential American players for a spin-off!

**Producer Guy:** Cate Blanchett?! American Squid Game?! My God, you're a genius! This is going to be huge! So, the baby, Jun-ho, Cate Blanchett... What a ride! I think we've officially squeezed every last drop of blood from this concept.

**Screenwriter Guy:** And tears, sir. Don't forget the tears. Lots and lots of tears.
