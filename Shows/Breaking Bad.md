**INT. EXECUTIVE PRODUCER'S OFFICE - DAY**

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, what have you got for me today? Anything good?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Oh, it's good. It's really good. So, we've got this guy, Walter White. He's a high school chemistry teacher. You know, mild-mannered, kinda meek, has a son with cerebral palsy, and his wife is pregnant. And get this... he gets diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Okay, so it's a tear-jerker? Like a "Make-A-Wish" type thing? We're going to get him a puppy before he kicks the bucket?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, no, no. See, he's worried about his family's financial future. So, he decides to use his chemistry skills to cook methamphetamine.

**PRODUCER GUY:** ...He cooks meth? A high school teacher? Is he going to wear a lab coat and safety goggles while he's doing it?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, eventually he gets pretty good at it! He teams up with his former student, Jesse Pinkman, who's a small-time dealer. And they start cooking in an RV out in the desert.

**PRODUCER GUY:** An RV? So it's like a meth-mobile? Does it have a spoiler? Flames painted on the side?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It's more... utilitarian. But the meth they make is super pure. And it's blue.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Blue meth? Why is it blue? Is it like, Smurf-flavored?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It's a chemical anomaly! It makes it unique, highly sought after. He takes on this alias, "Heisenberg."

**PRODUCER GUY:** Heisenberg? Is he going to walk around in a pork pie hat and sunglasses all the time? Is he a magician now, too? "For my next trick, I'll make a federal agent disappear!"

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Actually, his brother-in-law is a DEA agent. Hank.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, *that's* awkward. So he's cooking meth right under the nose of a DEA agent? Does Hank ever get suspicious? Like, does Walter start smelling like a chemical factory or something?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, there are a few close calls. And then things start to escalate. They get involved with a really scary drug lord named Tuco Salamanca.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Tuco? Is he going to be like, super aggressive and yell a lot?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He's... intense. Very intense. And then, later, they get involved with Gus Fring, who runs a fried chicken chain as a front for his drug empire.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, a chicken man who's also a drug lord? Does he offer a meth meal deal with extra crispy chicken? Is he going to die in some incredibly gruesome, surprising way?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** You'll have to watch to find out! But Walter gets deeper and deeper into this world. His wife, Skyler, eventually finds out. She's not thrilled.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, so she's going to be really upset and cry a lot, right? Maybe try to leave him?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** She actually starts helping him launder the money through a car wash.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A car wash! So, he's washing cars to clean dirty money? That's... surprisingly literal. Is it called "Heisenberg's Hot Suds"?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It's "A1A Car Wash." And Walter White, he changes. From this timid teacher to this ruthless, powerful drug lord. He makes some really dark choices. Like letting Jesse's girlfriend die. Or poisoning a kid.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Whoa, whoa, whoa. He lets someone die? And poisons a kid? Is he going to still be our protagonist? People are going to hate him!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** That's the point! It's about his transformation. The breaking bad of Walter White. It gets pretty intense. There's a big showdown with the Neo-Nazis, Hank dies, Jesse gets enslaved...

**PRODUCER GUY:** Jesse gets enslaved by Neo-Nazis?! Are they going to be like, a biker gang of meth cooks? This is getting pretty wild.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It culminates in Walter White making one final, desperate play to save Jesse and get his money back. It's a tragic, poetic ending.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Huh. A high school teacher, blue meth, a chicken drug lord, enslaved ex-students. You know what? I think this has potential. A lot of potential, actually. I think people are going to be really, really into this.
