**PRODUCER GUY:** So, you have a new Marvel show for me?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes sir, I do! It’s for Disney+, and it’s about one of our lesser-known heroes. Get ready for Moon Knight.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Moon Knight! Is he a knight that’s also a moon?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, not at all. So the show opens on this guy, Steven Grant. He works in a museum gift shop, he’s British, and he’s super awkward.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Okay, a relatable hero. What are his powers?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, he has crippling anxiety and he chains himself to his bed every night so he doesn’t wake up in a different country after having murdered several people.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wow wow wow… wow. That is not a very heroic power.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So he keeps blacking out, and when he comes to, he’s in the body of Marc Spector, a deadly American mercenary who is also him.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, so he has multiple personalities.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He does! And Marc is the avatar for an ancient Egyptian moon god named Khonshu who lives in his head and constantly tells him to kill people.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A nagging god in your brain sounds awful.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It is! So the main villain is Arthur Harrow, a cult leader who wants to resurrect the Egyptian goddess Ammit, who will judge everyone on Earth and kill them if they’re ever going to do something bad in the future.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, pre-crime. That seems morally questionable.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It is! And Harrow used to be Khonshu’s old avatar, so there’s some drama there. Anyway, Marc and Steven have to work together to stop him, but they hate each other and are constantly fighting for control of the body.

**PRODUCER GUY:** I’m sure that won’t be a problem when fighting a magic cult.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It’s a huge problem. So when Marc is in control, he can summon a cool superhero suit and he’s the Moon Knight. But when Steven is in control, he summons a nice three-piece suit and he’s Mr. Knight.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Mr. Knight? Does he defeat enemies by giving them stern financial advice?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, he just kind of awkwardly beats them up with batons. So Marc is married to this woman, Layla, who is an adventurer, but Steven has never met her and is very confused. They all have to team up to find Ammit’s tomb before Harrow does.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So they go to the other Egyptian gods for help?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** They do! But the other gods think Khonshu is a drama queen, so they put him on trial and then trap him in a little statue.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh no! So now Marc and Steven have no powers to fight the bad guy. It’s going to be tough to get out of that.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Actually, it’s super easy, barely an inconvenience.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, really?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah, so Harrow finds the tomb first and shoots Marc/Steven, killing them.

**PRODUCER GUY:** He kills the main characters halfway through the series?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He sure does! And they wake up in a mental institution which is actually the Egyptian underworld, and they have to navigate it with the help of a giant, friendly, talking hippopotamus goddess named Taweret.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A hippo goddess. You know, just when I think these movies can’t get any weirder, you go and add a hippo goddess.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So to escape the underworld, Marc and Steven have to balance their souls by confronting their shared trauma. It’s very emotional. Then they come back to life, Khonshu is freed, and they get their powers back.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Convenient. So what about Layla? Is she just watching all this happen?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, she makes a deal with the hippo goddess to become her temporary avatar, the Scarlet Scarab, and gets a cool supersuit with wings.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Of course she does.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So then there’s a giant CGI fight in Cairo between the giant god Khonshu and the giant alligator goddess Ammit, while Moon Knight and the Scarlet Scarab fight Harrow on the ground.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Giant gods fighting over a city. Very original.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So they manage to defeat Harrow and trap Ammit inside his body. Khonshu tells Marc to kill him, but Marc and Steven refuse, choosing to spare his life. They tell Khonshu to release them from his service.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wow, so they solve the problem without compromising their morals. But now the villain is still alive with an evil goddess inside him. It’s going to be tough to make sure he doesn’t cause any more trouble.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Actually, it’s going to be super easy, barely an inconvenience.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, really?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah, see, in the post-credits scene we learn there was a secret *third* personality the whole time, a ruthless Spanish-speaking limo driver named Jake Lockley. He’s still working for Khonshu, so he just wheels Harrow out of the hospital and shoots him in the back of the head. Problem solved!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Having a secret violent personality to do your dirty work for you is tight! Well, it’s a show about a man with multiple personalities arguing with a skeleton bird in his head and befriending a hippo goddess. I can’t imagine this will be very popular with mainstream audiences.
