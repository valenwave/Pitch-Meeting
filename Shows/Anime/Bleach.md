**PRODUCER GUY**: So you have a new anime for me?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**: Yes sir, I do. It’s called Bleach.

**PRODUCER GUY**: Bleach, huh? Is it about cleaning supplies? Because I’m not sure how exciting that would be.

**SCREENWRITER GUY**: No, no, it’s about a guy named Ichigo Kurosaki, who can see ghosts.

**PRODUCER GUY**: Okay, that’s a start. So he’s like, a ghost whisperer?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**: Well, one day he meets a Soul Reaper named Rukia Kuchiki, who’s hunting a Hollow.

**PRODUCER GUY**: A Hollow? What’s that? Some kind of… empty thing?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**: It’s a corrupted spirit that preys on humans. And Rukia gets injured fighting it, so she transfers her powers to Ichigo.

**PRODUCER GUY**: So he becomes a Soul Reaper. Just like that? Seems like a pretty significant power to just hand over.

**SCREENWRITER GUY**: Yeah, and then he has to take her place fighting Hollows while she recovers.

**PRODUCER GUY**: And she just… stays in his closet?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**: For a while, yeah. It’s a whole thing. But then, it turns out she’s a criminal for giving him her powers, so they send some other Soul Reapers to take her back to the Soul Society to be executed.

**PRODUCER GUY**: Executed, huh? So our hero’s new friend is about to die, and he has to save her? That sounds like a good arc. How does he get there?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**: He trains with this guy, Kisuke Urahara, who owns a candy store but is secretly a powerful former Soul Reaper captain. He gets Ichigo and his friends into the Soul Society through a portal.

**PRODUCER GUY**: Friends? So he’s not going alone? Who are these friends?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**: There’s Chad, who has super strength, Orihime, who has healing and shield powers, and Uryu, who’s a Quincy, a human who fights Hollows using spiritual energy.

**PRODUCER GUY**: So basically, a whole squad of super-powered teenagers. Got it. And they just… break into a spiritual afterlife society to save their friend from execution?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**: Precisely! And they have to fight their way through all the different divisions of Soul Reapers, who are all incredibly powerful.

**PRODUCER GUY**: And these Soul Reapers… they all have these elaborate outfits and giant swords?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**: Oh yeah, their swords are called Zanpakuto, and they have special abilities. And everyone has a unique Shikai and Bankai, which are like different power-up levels for their swords.

**PRODUCER GUY**: So everyone’s constantly getting stronger and unlocking new abilities? Seems like a good way to keep the action going. What about the villains? Is it just the Soul Reapers trying to stop them?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**: Well, at first, yes. But then it turns out the execution is part of a larger conspiracy involving the head captain, Sosuke Aizen, who faked his death and is trying to get a powerful artifact called the Hogyoku.

**PRODUCER GUY**: Whoa, plot twist! So the good guys are actually the bad guys, and the bad guys are… well, the even badder guys?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**: Something like that! Aizen wants to use the Hogyoku to create a King’s Key and overthrow the Soul King. And he has a whole army of Arrancars, which are Hollows who gained Soul Reaper powers.

**PRODUCER GUY**: Hollows with Soul Reaper powers? So they’re like, hybrid monsters? That’s pretty cool. This sounds like it could be a really long series.

**SCREENWRITER GUY**: It is! There are many, many episodes. And then there are Fullbringers, and the Thousand-Year Blood War arc with the Quincies, who are like, super powerful ancient enemies.

**PRODUCER GUY**: So it just keeps going and going, with new enemies and new power-ups? And everyone keeps yelling out the names of their attacks?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**: Yes, that’s a key part of it!

**PRODUCER GUY**: Alright, alright, I think this could work. It’s got action, it’s got mystery, it’s got cool powers. People love that stuff. I think this anime is going to be a big hit.
