Screenwriter Guy: So, I have this idea for a show. It's about a teenager who can see ghosts.

Producer Guy: Okay, so, like, *The Sixth Sense* meets, uh, *Saved by the Bell*? I'm intrigued.

Screenwriter Guy: No, no, it's more than just seeing ghosts. He, uh, he becomes a Soul Reaper.

Producer Guy: A... Soul Reaper. So, like, a grim reaper, but for souls? So he's, like, a celestial garbage man?

Screenwriter Guy: Well, he helps them pass on, and sometimes, he has to fight evil spirits called Hollows. And he gets this giant sword!

Producer Guy: A giant sword. So, like, Cloud Strife, but, you know, for ghosts. Does it glow? It needs to glow.

Screenwriter Guy: It does! And it gets bigger sometimes! And he has this spiritual energy called Reiatsu!

Producer Guy: Reiatsu. So, like, the Force, but for, uh, ghost battles? Can he lift rocks with it? Because if he can lift rocks, we're golden.

Screenwriter Guy: Not exactly. But he can do these cool spiritual attacks, and, uh, he has this friend who's a talking cat.

Producer Guy: A talking cat! Is it like Garfield? Is it sarcastic? Because I need a sarcastic talking cat.

Screenwriter Guy: No, it's more like a wise, ancient spirit. And he's got this whole organization of Soul Reapers in the Soul Society!

Producer Guy: The Soul Society. So, like, a DMV for dead people? Do they have cubicles? I'm picturing cubicles.

Screenwriter Guy: It's more like a feudal Japanese society, with different squads and captains, and they all have their own unique powers, andâ€”

Producer Guy: Wait, so your main character is fighting these evil spirits, but then he's *also* fighting other Soul Reapers sometimes? Is this an internal struggle, or just, like, Tuesday?

Screenwriter Guy: Well, sometimes he has to rescue his friends, and some Soul Reapers are, you know, not so good. And there's this whole arc where he goes to save his friend from being executed!

Producer Guy: Executed! So, like, *The Green Mile*, but with, uh, soul swords? Does he have to, like, sneak in? Is there a prison break involved? Because I love a good prison break.

Screenwriter Guy: There's definitely a lot of sneaking and fighting involved! And he eventually gets a new, even stronger power called a Bankai!

Producer Guy: A Bankai! So, like, Super Saiyan, but, uh, for sword-wielding ghost busters. Does his hair change color? It should totally change color.

Screenwriter Guy: Not his hair, but his sword definitely changes! And he gets faster and stronger!

Producer Guy: Okay, okay, I'm liking this. Lots of fighting, cool powers, a talking animal, and a giant sword that glows. This has all the makings of a hit!
