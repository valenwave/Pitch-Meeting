Sure, here's a pitch meeting for Fullmetal Alchemist:
## Fullmetal Alchemist Pitch Meeting

**INT. PRODUCER GUY'S OFFICE - DAY**

PRODUCER GUY sips his comically oversized coffee mug, looking unimpressed. SCREENWRITER GUY nervously shuffles his notes.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So, I have this idea for an anime. It's called Fullmetal Alchemist!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Fullmetal... Alchemist. Is that like, a band? With a guy who plays a really big drum kit made of metal?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, no. It's about alchemy! Like, turning lead into gold! But with a very strict rule called "Equivalent Exchange."

**PRODUCER GUY:** Equivalent Exchange. So, if I want to turn my coffee into, say, a brand new Ferrari, I need to give up... another Ferrari? Seems a bit pointless, doesn't it?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, it's more about matter and energy. To gain something, you have to lose something of equal value. And the main characters, two brothers named Edward and Alphonse Elric, learned this the hard way.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, really? What happened? Did they try to turn their homework into an A+ and their dog vanished?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Worse. They tried to bring their dead mother back to life using forbidden human transmutation. And the price... Edward lost an arm and a leg, and Alphonse lost his entire body, with his soul only barely bound to a suit of armor!

**PRODUCER GUY:** (Spits out his coffee) Woah, woah, woah. So one kid is a walking mech suit, and the other is a one-armed, one-legged kid with metal prosthetics? That's... surprisingly dark for a show with a kid in a giant suit of armor.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly! It's a dark fantasy, but with a lot of heart! They're searching for the legendary Philosopher's Stone to get their bodies back.

**PRODUCER GUY:** The Philosopher's Stone, huh? So it's basically Harry Potter meets Transformers?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** (Frustrated) It's not! It's much deeper! They encounter a military conspiracy, shadowy figures called Homunculi who embody the seven deadly sins, and even a guy who transmutes his own daughter and dog into a grotesque chimera!

**PRODUCER GUY:** (Raises an eyebrow) He did *what* now? So, like, a sad dog-girl fusion? This just keeps getting weirder! And these Homunculi, they're like, super villains? What kind of powers do they have?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Oh, they're all unique! There's Lust, who has extendable fingers that can pierce anything. Gluttony, who eats everything. Pride, who's a living shadow. It's very cool!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Okay, okay. So, two brothers, one's a tin can, the other's got robot parts. They're looking for a magic rock, fighting a secret government conspiracy, and also a bunch of personified sins. And there's a dog-girl. Is there, like, a cute mechanic girl too, to fix the robot arm?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes! Winry Rockbell! She's their childhood friend and a brilliant automail engineer! She constantly fixes Edward's arm after he breaks it in fights.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Of course there is. And what's the big bad? Some ultimate alchemist who wants to turn the whole world into a giant Philosopher's Stone?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** You're surprisingly close! There's a character known as "Father" who created the Homunculi and plans to use a nationwide transmutation circle to absorb God and become the ultimate being!

**PRODUCER GUY:** (Nods slowly) Wow. So, a lot of intense existential dread mixed with explosions and people turning into other people. And the resolution? Do they get their bodies back?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, in the end, Edward sacrifices his ability to use alchemy to bring Alphonse's body back, fully restored! Alphonse decides to travel the world to learn more about alchemy and medicine, and Edward settles down with Winry and they have a family!

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, the main character gives up his powers to save his brother, and then gets the girl and a family? That's... surprisingly wholesome for a show with a dog-girl fusion. You know what? I think this could actually do really well. It's got action, mystery, emotional stakes, and a strong sense of family. Plus, that dog-girl thing is going to get people talking.

**FADE OUT.**
