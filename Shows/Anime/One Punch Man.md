So you have an anime series for me?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes sir, I do! It’s a superhero story that deconstructs the entire superhero genre.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, a deconstruction! Is it going to be super dark and gritty? Because dark and gritty is tight.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Not exactly. It's more of a comedy. The main hero is the strongest person in the entire universe.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Okay, so he's on a journey to become the strongest?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, he's already there when the story starts. He can defeat any enemy with just one single punch.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh! One punch! So that's the name of the show?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** That's the name of the show!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wow, that's convenient. So what's the conflict? If he can beat anyone in one punch, the fights must be pretty short.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** They are. In fact, they’re a massive inconvenience for the main character. He’s become completely bored with fighting because there’s no challenge. His biggest struggle is a self-imposed existential crisis.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A hero who’s sad because he’s too good at being a hero?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly! He’s more worried about missing bargain day at the supermarket than a city-destroying monster.

**PRODUCER GUY:** This sounds... weirdly relatable. So how did he get these incredible powers? Was he bitten by a radioactive bald eagle?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Not at all. He just did 100 push-ups, 100 sit-ups, 100 squats, and ran 10 kilometers. Every single day.

**PRODUCER GUY:** That's it? That's the secret? That sounds like a basic workout.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It is, but he did it so hard that all his hair fell out and he broke his natural human limiter.

**PRODUCER GUY:** He broke his what now?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** His limiter! It’s the thing that stops people from getting too strong. He just… worked out until it broke.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wow. Super easy, barely an inconvenience. So he must be a celebrated hero, right? The top of the Hero Association?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Oh, about that. He bombs the written portion of the hero certification exam, so he gets placed in C-Class, the lowest rank. Most people think he's a fraud who just steals credit from other heroes.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So the strongest being in the universe is a low-ranked nobody who nobody respects?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** You got it. But he does get a disciple! A super-serious cyborg named Genos who sees him defeat a monster and immediately demands to be trained by him.

**PRODUCER GUY:** What does the cyborg think of his master's intense training regimen?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He refuses to believe it and thinks Saitama is hiding the true secret to his power. Genos is an S-Class hero, by the way. The highest rank.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So the sidekick is way more respected and famous than the main character?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** All the way. Genos will give these long, dramatic monologues about justice and vengeance, and Saitama will just be sitting on the floor reading manga.

**PRODUCER GUY:** I like this dynamic. Tell me about some villains. They must be terrifying to warrant a hero this strong.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** They are! There’s a giant lobster monster named Crablante who turned into a monster because he ate too much crab.

**PRODUCER GUY:** He ate too much crab.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes. And there’s an alien conqueror named Boros who travels the galaxy looking for a worthy opponent. He hears a prophecy that he’ll find his match on Earth.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, so this Boros guy is the one! He’s the one who can withstand more than one punch!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, Saitama does have to use a "Serious Punch" on him.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A "Serious Punch"! What does that do?!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It’s a punch... but, you know, serious. It parts the clouds across the entire planet. But afterwards, Saitama is just disappointed again because the fight didn't last long enough.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So he finally gets his epic battle and he's still bummed out?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yep. It’s a real tragedy for him. He gets kicked to the moon during the fight, and he’s just mildly annoyed that he has to hold his breath and jump back.

**PRODUCER GUY:** He jumps back from the moon? That seems physically sound.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Don’t worry about it. So we'll have all these incredibly detailed and beautifully animated fight scenes with other heroes struggling, getting beaten up, giving it their all... and then Saitama just shows up at the last second and solves the problem with a single, bored-looking punch.

**PRODUCER GUY:** I love it. The ultimate anticlimax.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** And sometimes he won’t even mean to! He’ll just be trying to swat a mosquito and accidentally blow a guy through a mountain.

**PRODUCER GUY:** An accidental mountain-destroying punch sounds awesome. What do you think?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** I think people will love a story where the main character is already the best, and his real journey is trying to feel anything at all. Also, there are lots of explosions.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A hero who is existentially bored with his own god-like power is the most ridiculous and brilliant thing I've ever heard. It’ll never sell, but I love it. Let’s make it!
