**INT. STUDIO EXECUTIVE'S OFFICE - DAY**

PRODUCER GUY sips from a very large, very expensive coffee mug. SCREENWRITER GUY sits nervously opposite him, clutching a dog-eared script.

**PRODUCER GUY**
Alright, so you've got this… "One Piece" thing. It's an anime, right? One of those… *long* ones?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
Yes, sir! It’s one of the most popular manga and anime series of all time! It's about a young boy named Monkey D. Luffy who eats a magical fruit and becomes a rubber man, and he wants to be the King of the Pirates and find the legendary treasure, the One Piece!

**PRODUCER GUY**
A rubber man, you say. So he stretches? Like, Mr. Fantastic, but... a pirate?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
Exactly! He can stretch his arms and legs, punch really hard, bounce off things... it's very versatile!

**PRODUCER GUY**
Okay, okay. So he’s got a crew, I assume? Every pirate needs a crew. Is it like… handsome pirates? Gritty pirates?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
Well, his first mate is Roronoa Zoro, a master swordsman who uses *three* swords. One in each hand, and one in his mouth!

**PRODUCER GUY**
*Three* swords? In his *mouth*? How does he… talk? Or chew? Or do anything, really, when he's got a sword in his mouth? Does he brush his teeth? Seems like a hygiene nightmare.

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
It’s very cool, trust me! Then there’s Nami, a brilliant navigator and a master thief. She's after treasure for her own reasons.

**PRODUCER GUY**
A thief, huh? So she's going to be stealing from *our* hero? That feels… counterproductive for a crew.

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
No, no, she eventually joins his crew for good! And then there's Usopp, a sharpshooter and a self-proclaimed liar.

**PRODUCER GUY**
A liar? So he’s just… unreliable? Great. We need people the audience can root for, not wonder if everything they say is made up. What's his superpower, besides lying? Is he really good at lying?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
He's an amazing marksman! And he tells grand tales, which eventually inspire him to be braver. And then there’s Sanji, the chef! He fights with his legs because his hands are too precious for cooking!

**PRODUCER GUY**
So a chef who can't use his hands to fight… on a pirate ship. Is he going to trip over his own feet mid-fight and spill the stew? And how do we make a guy who fights with his legs look cool? Is it like, ballet-kicking pirates? Because I'm not sure that's the gritty pirate action we're looking for.

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
No, it's very dynamic! He's a martial artist! And their adventures involve fighting against fish-men, clowns who can split their bodies apart…

**PRODUCER GUY**
A clown who splits apart? So like, if he gets hit, he just… scatters? How do you even beat a guy like that? Do you just pick up all his pieces and put him in a jar?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
He's a very memorable villain, Buggy the Clown! And there's a powerful fish-man named Arlong who gives them a lot of trouble. The whole show is about them gathering their crew and sailing across the Grand Line!

**PRODUCER GUY**
Okay, so it's a huge, sprawling world with a talking reindeer doctor later on, probably, and everyone's got some kind of wacky power or gimmick. And we're going to make this live-action? With actual people? We're going to have a guy whose arms stretch like Gumby, a guy with three swords in his mouth, a chef who only kicks, and a clown who explodes. This just feels like... a lot of things that could go very, very wrong. We've tried live-action anime before, and historically, it's been... well, let's just say it's been a *learning experience*.

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
But this time it's different! We have the original creator, Eiichiro Oda, involved! He's a creative consultant! He’ll make sure it's good!

**PRODUCER GUY**
Okay, well, if Oda-san is on board, maybe there’s a chance. Maybe. We'll give it a shot. I mean, what's the worst that could happen? It breaks the curse of bad anime adaptations? Ha! Good one, me.

**Producer Guy laughs, then takes another long sip from his mug.**

**PRODUCER GUY**
I’m predicting… moderate success. Like, maybe a decent cult following, but nothing groundbreaking. It's a niche market, after all.
