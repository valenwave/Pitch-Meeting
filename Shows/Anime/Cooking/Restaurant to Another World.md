**PRODUCER GUY:** So you have an anime for me?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes sir, I do! It's a new take on the isekai genre.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh boy. Let me guess, a sad office worker gets hit by a truck and is reborn in a fantasy world with an overpowered skill called [Super Spreadsheet Management]?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Not exactly! In this one, it’s a restaurant that gets isekai'd.

**PRODUCER GUY:** The whole restaurant? Does it get dropped on a witch or something?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, no. So there’s this pretty normal Japanese place called the Western Restaurant Nekoya. It's closed on Saturdays.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Okay, giving the staff a day off is tight.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It is, but on that Saturday, the restaurant’s door magically appears in various locations all over a fantasy world.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, so the chef goes on an adventure through the door to fight slimes and level up his cooking skills?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Nope, he just stays in the kitchen and cooks. People from the fantasy world come through the door into his restaurant.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Ah, an invasion! And the chef has to defend his restaurant from knights and wizards using only a spatula and his wits!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, they just sit down and order food.

**PRODUCER GUY:** …What?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah, that’s the show. Each episode we meet a new fantasy character who stumbles upon the door, enters the restaurant, and is completely blown away by modern food.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So what kind of characters are we talking about?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, there’s a legendary red dragon who comes in.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Okay! So she breathes fire and the chef has to cook her a meal that can withstand dragon-level heat!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, she just really loves the beef stew. And there’s a master swordsman who becomes obsessed with teriyaki chicken. And a treasure hunter who can’t get enough of the minced meat cutlet.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wow wow wow… wow. So the entire show is just watching fantasy creatures eat regular food?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Pretty much! We spend a lot of time describing the savory sauces and the crispy textures. It’s very relaxing.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Okay, so who runs this place?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** A guy we just call "Master" or "Tenshu." He’s very stoic and a great cook. He needs some help, so he hires a poor, homeless demon girl he finds sleeping in the restaurant.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A demon girl! So she uses her demonic powers to enchant the food and make it irresistible?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, she just becomes a very polite and efficient waitress. Her name is Aletta.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** And then he hires another waitress named Kuro. She’s an ancient, super-powerful dragon deity who can take human form.

**PRODUCER GUY:** And what does she do? Use her ancient magic to keep the floors clean?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Basically, yeah. She mostly stands there and communicates telepathically, but she really, really loves chicken curry. She basically works for free food.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A literal god is working for minimum wage and a plate of curry?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Super easy, barely an inconvenience.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So where is the conflict in this story? Is there an evil food critic from the fantasy world trying to shut them down?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Not really. The biggest conflict we have is when a lion-man who loves pork cutlet bowls gets into a heated argument with a knight who loves fried shrimp about which dish is better.

**PRODUCER GUY:** An argument is the central conflict?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes. And the Master resolves it by just making them both their favorite food.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So there are zero stakes.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** The stakes are whether or not someone gets to have a delicious, life-changing meal. And they always do.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wait a minute, how are these people paying? I don't think they have Japanese Yen in the dragon kingdom.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** They just pay with gold coins and the Master is totally cool with it. He doesn’t really question having a till full of currency from another dimension.

**PRODUCER GUY:** This Master guy is almost suspiciously chill.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He really is.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, let me see if I've got this. The entire anime is about people from a fantasy world finding a restaurant, eating food, having what amounts to a religious experience over a plate of spaghetti, and then going home. There’s no plot, no action, no villain, and no stakes.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** You nailed it! It's the ultimate comfort food show. What do you think?

**PRODUCER GUY:** You know what? The world is a stressful place. An anime that is literally just about people being happy and enjoying a good meal might just be a genius idea. It's so wholesome.
