**PRODUCER GUY:** So, you have an anime series for me?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes sir, I do. It’s a fantasy adventure show!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, great! So we’ve got a hero with a giant sword, a quest to save the world, big epic battles?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, no. The adventure is finding a restaurant. And the quest is to eat food.

**PRODUCER GUY:** The quest is to eat food.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes! So the show opens on a seemingly normal Western-style restaurant in a Japanese shopping district. It's called Youshoku no Nekoya.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Okay.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** But here's the twist: every Saturday, the restaurant closes to the public, and its doors magically connect to a fantasy world!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, an isekai! So our hero, a regular Japanese high school student, gets transported to the fantasy world through the restaurant door?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Nope. The fantasy world comes to the restaurant. The main character is just the chef. He's called Master.

**PRODUCER GUY:** And what's his deal? Is he a retired adventurer? Does he fight monsters with a magic frying pan?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, he’s just a regular guy who inherited the restaurant from his grandfather. He just cooks.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So… there’s no fighting?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Not really. So, the first customer we really meet is this ancient, all-powerful red dragon.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wow wow wow… wow! A dragon! So she’s going to demand tribute or try to burn the place down?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, she just orders a giant pot of beef stew. She loves it so much she calls it her treasure.

**PRODUCER GUY:** An ancient dragon’s most prized treasure is… beef stew.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It’s very good beef stew, sir. So then the Master needs a new waitress.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Okay, where does he put out the want ad? The "Ye Olde Help Wanted" section of the Fantasyland Chronicle?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** A demon girl with horns just kind of stumbles into the restaurant by accident because she’s poor and starving. So he gives her a meal and a job.

**PRODUCER GUY:** He just hires a demon off the street? What about a background check? References?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** She’s very polite. It’s fine. And then he hires another waitress, who is a dragon demigod of death that can only communicate telepathically.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So his staff is a normal dude, a demon, and a silent dragon god. This restaurant must have a fascinating workplace dynamic.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It's very calm, actually. So the plot of each episode is basically a new customer from the fantasy world comes in. It could be a legendary swordsman, a half-elf princess, a lizardman warrior, a dwarven blacksmith...

**PRODUCER GUY:** Okay, and what do they do? Do their rivalries spill into the dining room? Do they hatch epic plans?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, they just eat food and talk about how unbelievably delicious it is.

**PRODUCER GUY:** That’s the whole show?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Pretty much! The legendary swordsman has a borderline religious experience eating a pork cutlet bowl. A group of fairies goes absolutely bonkers for the fruit crepes. The lizardman risks his life just to come eat omelet rice every Saturday.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Omelet rice is worth risking your life for?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** In this restaurant it is, sir! The whole conflict of the show is characters from different backgrounds arguing over which dish is the best.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So instead of good versus evil, it’s Pork Loin vs. Minced Meat Cutlet.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly! It gets pretty heated. But then the Master just serves them both and they realize all food is good.

**PRODUCER GUY:** I feel like a lot of real-world conflicts could be solved that way.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** For sure. So at one point, a famous treasure hunter finds the restaurant and is determined to claim the treasure within.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, man. It’s going to be tough for her to get past a staff of demons and dragons.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Actually, it’s going to be super easy, barely an inconvenience.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, really?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah, she just orders the minced meat cutlet, decides it's the greatest treasure she's ever found, and becomes a regular customer.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So the treasure was the food all along.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It’s a metaphor!

**PRODUCER GUY:** So what’s the big season finale? Does a powerful mage try to steal the restaurant's magical secrets? Does the fantasy world and the modern world go to war over the last chocolate parfait?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, the season just sort of ends. It’s another Saturday, everyone comes in, enjoys their favorite meal, and then goes home happy, looking forward to next week.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So… nothing happens? At all?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** The characters learn to appreciate each other and find a common ground through their shared love of food! It’s wholesome!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wholesome. You want to make a cozy, low-stakes anime about fantasy creatures eating food with absolutely no action or overarching plot.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes! It’s the ultimate comfort food show!

**PRODUCER GUY:** You know what? I’m exhausted by saving the world all the time. An anime where the biggest problem is running out of fried shrimp sounds incredibly relaxing. I think people will be hungry for this.
