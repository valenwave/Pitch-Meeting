**PRODUCER GUY:** So you have an anime for me?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes sir, I do! It's basically a Dungeons and Dragons campaign mixed with a cooking show. It's called Delicious in Dungeon!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Delicious in... what now? Sounds a little weird.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, sir, it's a wholesome fantasy adventure! So the story follows this party of adventurers led by a guy named Laios.

**PRODUCER GUY:** And what's his deal?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He is super, super into monsters. He has a deep, burning desire to know what they all taste like.

**PRODUCER GUY:** He wants to *eat* the monsters?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly! So, his sister Falin gets eaten whole by a giant red dragon deep in a dungeon.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh my god, she's dead! That's horrible.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, no. See, in this world, as long as a monster hasn't fully digested you, you can be revived.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, that's incredibly convenient.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Super easy, barely an inconvenience! So Laios and his remaining party members, the elf mage Marcille and the halfling rogue Chilchuck, have to race back to the bottom of the dungeon to save her before she becomes dragon poop.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A classic rescue mission against a ticking, biological clock. I like it.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** But there's a problem! They lost all their money and supplies when they barely escaped the dragon's lair.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh no! So I guess they have to go back to town and grind for some gold to buy new gear?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Nope! Laios has a brilliant, money-saving idea: they'll just eat the monsters they kill on the way down!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wait, seriously? Like, giant scorpions and walking mushrooms?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** And slimes, and basilisks, and living armor! If it moves, it's on the menu.

**PRODUCER GUY:** That sounds absolutely disgusting.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** That's where Senshi comes in! He's a dwarf who has lived in the dungeon for a decade, mastering the culinary arts of monster cookery. He joins their party and teaches them how to turn these horrifying creatures into gourmet meals.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A dungeon chef. Of course, there's a dungeon chef.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** And we get these super detailed segments where he explains exactly how to prepare everything. Like how to make a tart out of a man-eating plant or an omelet from a basilisk.

**PRODUCER GUY:** I'm both intrigued and horrified.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** That's the sweet spot, sir! So the elf, Marcille, is constantly grossed out by all of this, but she eats it anyway because she's starving. And Chilchuck is just trying to be the one sane person in the group who wants to get the job done.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A balanced party dynamic. I get it.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Nutritionally and adventuring-wise! But as they go deeper, they realize there's a bigger plot involving a mad magician who controls the dungeon.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Ah, so it's not just "Monster of the Week, Meal of the Day."

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly! There's lore and mystery. And at one point they have to make sorbet using ghosts to chill it.

**PRODUCER GUY:** How do you even catch a ghost to make sorbet?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** With great difficulty, sir. So eventually they make it to the dragon. They fight it, they kill it, and then they cook it.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Of course, they eat the dragon that ate their sister. Makes sense.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** They sure do. A big ol' dragon katsu! And they manage to revive Falin!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Hooray! A happy ending.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Not quite. See, the mad magician used some of Falin's remains to resurrect the dragon, so now she's been revived as a weird human-dragon chimera.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wow wow wow... wow. So fixing that is going to be incredibly difficult, I imagine.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Actually, it's going to be super easy, barely an inconvenience.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, really?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah, all Laios has to do is defeat the all-powerful mad magician, become the new master of the ancient, sentient dungeon, and then use its reality-warping powers to wish his sister back to normal.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Simple!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So, what do you think?

**PRODUCER GUY:** A fantasy adventure where the main motivation is equal parts saving a loved one and extreme culinary curiosity. It's weird, it's charming, and for some reason, I'm starving. I think it's gonna be a hit.
