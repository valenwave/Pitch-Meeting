**PRODUCER GUY:** So, you got an anime series for me?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes sir, I do. It’s a cooking anime.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A cooking anime? Okay. Are people going to be throwing knives at each other and stuff?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No sir, not really. This is about an elite culinary high school called Totsuki Academy, where only the best of the best get to graduate.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A high-stakes high school. I like it. So who’s our main character?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Our hero is Soma Yukihira. He’s a super talented chef who grew up working in his dad’s humble diner.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A classic underdog story! Love it.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yep. So one day his dad, who is secretly one of the most legendary chefs in the entire world, decides to close the diner and sends Soma to Totsuki to hone his skills.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, his dad is secretly a world-famous chef? That seems pretty convenient.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It is! So at this school, all disputes, from getting ingredients to challenging the top students, are settled through cooking battles called “Shokugeki.”

**PRODUCER GUY:** Food Wars! I get the title now.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** You do! So in these battles, they cook these incredible dishes for a panel of judges.

**PRODUCER GUY:** And I assume the food is very good.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Sir, the food is so mind-blowingly delicious that it causes anyone who eats it to have… let’s call them ‘intense culinary epiphanies.’

**PRODUCER GUY:** What does that mean?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It means their clothes explode off their bodies in waves of pure, delicious ecstasy.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wow wow wow… wow. Their clothes just… explode?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It’s a visual metaphor for how good the food is! It’s all happening in their minds. We think.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A metaphorical nudity dimension. Got it. So who does Soma have to fight with his food?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** His main rival is Erina Nakiri, the granddaughter of the school's dean. She has a divine sense of taste known as the "God Tongue," so she looks down on his common diner food. There are also tons of other chefs who specialize in things like smoked meats, wild game, and Italian food.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So it’s a whole universe of food fighters.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly! And they all live in this dorm together called the Polaris Dormitory, where they have to constantly prove their skills just to stay residents.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Okay, so how do we keep things exciting? I can’t just watch kids make eggs for five seasons, no matter how many clothes are exploding.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, there are training camps from hell run by alumni, a giant school festival, and intense tournaments like the Autumn Elections to determine the best first-year students.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Autumn Elections? Is he running for student body president?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, it’s a cooking tournament. And eventually, Erina’s evil, food-fascist father, Azami, takes over the school and tries to outlaw all culinary freedom.

**PRODUCER GUY:** An evil dad wants to stop people from being creative with food? What a monster!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** I know! So Soma has to lead a team of rebel chefs to take back the school in a massive team-based Shokugeki.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So it’s a rebellion fought with risotto.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Pretty much. And at one point, Soma has to create a world-class dish to avoid expulsion using only leftover ingredients he finds in the kitchen.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh man, that sounds impossible. It’s going to be tough for him to pass that.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Actually, it’s going to be super easy, barely an inconvenience.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, really?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah, he just whips up some fake pork roast using bacon and potatoes and it blows everyone away. He’s very resourceful.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So a battle anime with food, a secret legendary dad, and metaphorical nudity. This is one of the most ridiculous things I've ever heard.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So you don’t like it?

**PRODUCER GUY:** I love it! It's completely bonkers. This has everything: action, drama, and educational tidbits about cooking techniques. The fans are gonna eat this up.
