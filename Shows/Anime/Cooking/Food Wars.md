**PRODUCER GUY:** So, you have an anime for me?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes sir, I do! It’s a high-stakes, action-packed show about… cooking.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Cooking? Is this for that channel my grandma watches during the day?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, no, this is for teens! It’s set at Totsuki Saryo Culinary Academy, the most elite cooking high school in the entire world. The graduation rate is less than 1 percent.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A high school that’s harder to get through than Navy SEAL training? For cooking?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly! And our hero is Soma Yukihira, a plucky kid who learned everything he knows working at his dad's small-town diner. So he shows up at this super-elite school and on the very first day, he declares he's going to be number one.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, so all the rich, snobby students are going to hate him for that.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** They absolutely are! Especially Erina Nakiri, the headmaster's granddaughter, who has a supernatural ability called the "God Tongue." She can taste food and know every single ingredient with perfect accuracy.

**PRODUCER GUY:** She has a magic tongue. Got it.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So for the entrance exam, she asks him to make a dish with eggs. So he makes a simple rice and egg dish from his diner.

**PRODUCER GUY:** And she hates it because it’s not fancy enough, right?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** She secretly loves it but is too proud to admit it, so she fails him!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, but he gets in anyway.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah, the headmaster overrules her. He’s a fun old guy who sometimes gets naked for no reason.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wow wow wow… wow.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So the main thing at this school are "Shokugeki," which are high-stakes cooking battles. Students can wager anything. Their dorms, their cooking tools, even their future at the school.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So you can get expelled because your risotto was slightly under-seasoned?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes! And the battles are judged by a panel of experts. And when they eat the food, something incredible happens.

**PRODUCER GUY:** What’s that?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Their clothes explode.

**PRODUCER GUY:** I’m sorry, what was that now?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** The food is just so mind-blowingly delicious that it creates a metaphorical explosion of flavor that literally blows their clothes off. Sometimes they find themselves wrestling a magical squid in a field of buttercups. It’s a metaphor!

**PRODUCER GUY:** So people get naked from eating food. Is this show… you know… for adults?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It’s about being passionate about your craft, sir! A very wholesome craft!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Okay. So this diner kid has to compete against geniuses who specialize in things like molecular gastronomy and aging meat for 40 days. It's going to be tough for him to win.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Actually, it’s going to be super easy, barely an inconvenience.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, really?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah, see, he’ll be up against a master of Italian cuisine, for example. And Soma will just use his diner-honed skills to make a completely bizarre but delicious dish that no one expects, and the judges’ clothes will fly right off.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Of course they will.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So he’ll make his way through a bunch of challenges. He’ll have a rival with silver hair named Takumi Aldini. He’ll have a shy but talented friend named Megumi Tadokoro. He’ll even have to save his dorm from being demolished by winning a Shokugeki.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So he just wins all the time?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, he loses a big one to the top student, the head of the "Elite Ten Council" that runs the school. But that just makes him want to get better!

**PRODUCER GUY:** A council of high schoolers runs the most prestigious culinary institution on the planet. Makes sense.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** But then things get real! Erina’s evil dad, Azami, shows up. He was exiled from the culinary world, but now he’s back and he takes over the school!

**PRODUCER GUY:** How?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He gets the majority of the Elite Ten to vote for him.

**PRODUCER GUY:** The high school cooking council can stage a coup?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** They sure can! And Azami’s philosophy is that only ultra-gourmet, perfect food should exist. He shuts down all the clubs and forces everyone to cook from his approved recipes. No more creativity!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh no! Not the lack of creativity!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So Soma and his rebel friends have to challenge Azami’s new Elite Ten to a massive team Shokugeki called a Regiment de Cuisine. If they win, Azami is out and they get all the seats on the council. If they lose, they’re all expelled.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So they have to beat the best student chefs in the country, all of whom have been brainwashed by this evil dad.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly! And they’ll have to cook things like bear meat and alligator. And in the final battle, Soma and Erina will team up and make a dish so unbelievably delicious…

**PRODUCER GUY:** Let me guess. It blows the evil dad’s clothes off?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It blows his clothes off so hard that his evil food philosophy is destroyed and he becomes a good guy again.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wow. Food is powerful.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** The most powerful force in the universe, sir. So what do you think?

**PRODUCER GUY:** High-stakes cooking battles where delicious food makes people’s clothes explode. I don’t understand why, but I have a feeling people are going to eat this up.
