**INT. PRODUCER GUY'S OFFICE - DAY**

PRODUCER GUY sits across from SCREENWRITER GUY, who beams with enthusiasm.

**PRODUCER GUY**
Alright, so what's this new anime pitch you've got for me? We've had a lot of success with fantasy stuff lately. Is it another one of those where a guy gets hit by a truck and becomes super powerful in another world? Because, you know, we have like, ten of those in development already.

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
Not exactly! This is different. It's called *Delicious in Dungeon*.

**PRODUCER GUY**
*Delicious in Dungeon*? Is it, like, a cooking show set in a prison? Because I'm not sure that's a crossover anyone was asking for. "Today, on *Iron Chef: Cell Block C*..."

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
No, no! It's a fantasy adventure! Our main character, Laios, and his party are deep in a dungeon, trying to rescue his sister, who just got eaten by a red dragon!

**PRODUCER GUY**
Okay, eaten by a dragon. So it's a dramatic race against time, high stakes, intense battles?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
Well, yes, but also... they're really broke. Like, no money for food. So, Laios has this brilliant idea.

**PRODUCER GUY**
Oh, here we go. He finds a magical vending machine? He sells his soul for a sandwich?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
He decides they should *eat the monsters* they encounter in the dungeon!

Producer Guy blinks. Slowly.

**PRODUCER GUY**
They... eat the monsters? You mean like, if they fight a giant scorpion, they're going to butter it up and have it with a nice chianti?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
Exactly! We'll have detailed recipes, culinary explanations, how to properly clean a slime, the best way to roast a walking mushroom, why basilisk is surprisingly delicious if prepared correctly...

**PRODUCER GUY**
So, they're adventurers, but also gourmet chefs of grotesque creatures? This elf character, Marcille, she's probably all about this, right? She's a hardcore survivalist?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
Oh, no, Marcille is absolutely horrified by the whole idea. She's constantly gagging and complaining, but then she tries it and admits it's actually good. It's a running gag!

**PRODUCER GUY**
A running gag where the audience gets to watch someone reluctantly eat goblin stew. Riveting. And the dwarf, Senshi? He's the grumpy warrior type?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
Senshi is actually the *monster cooking expert*! He's lived in the dungeon for years, perfected his monster recipes, and he's super enthusiastic about it! He basically joins them to ensure the dragon meat is prepared properly once they rescue Laios's sister.

**PRODUCER GUY**
Wait, he's more interested in the *dragon meat* than the rescue mission?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
Well, it's a very rare ingredient! He's quite passionate. And we get to explore the ecology of the dungeon through the food! We'll show how coin bugs lay eggs in mimics, creating a natural cycle of fake gold and insect larvae!

Producer Guy stares blankly.

**PRODUCER GUY**
So, it's a fantasy show, but instead of focusing on epic battles, we're doing a bizarre nature documentary combined with a cooking competition, all while trying to rescue a sister from a dragon's stomach before she, what, gets fully digested?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
Yes! And the dungeon itself is full of mysteries and a whole economy around adventuring and resurrection, but our characters are too busy figuring out if a mandrake root goes well with giant bat wings!

**PRODUCER GUY**
Okay, so we have a desperate rescue mission, but the characters are primarily concerned with whether the monster they just killed is going to taste good. And one of them is obsessed with eating monsters. That feels... *different*. It feels like it could either be a massive, confusing failure, or... something strangely endearing.

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
Endearing! Definitely endearing!

**PRODUCER GUY**
You know what? Fine. There's something so utterly absurd about it, it just might work. People are tired of the same old fantasy tropes. Let's make a show about eating monsters.

**CUT TO BLACK.**
