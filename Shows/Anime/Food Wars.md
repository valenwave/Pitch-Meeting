PRODUCER GUY: So, you have an anime series for me?
SCREENWRITER GUY: Yes sir, I do. It’s about a high school that’s super hard to get into, and even harder to graduate from.
PRODUCER GUY: Oh, one of those fancy prep schools for future politicians and doctors?
SCREENWRITER GUY: Not exactly. It’s a culinary school.
PRODUCER GUY: A cooking school is super hard to graduate from? What do they do, expel you if your souffle doesn’t rise high enough?
SCREENWRITER GUY: Yes, that is literally a thing that happens. The graduation rate is less than one percent.
PRODUCER GUY: What kind of business model is that? Why would anyone pay tuition for a school they are almost guaranteed to be expelled from?
SCREENWRITER GUY: So our hero is Soma Yukihira. His dad runs a small family diner, and he’s been cooking his whole life. His dad decides to close the diner to go work around the world and sends Soma to this elite school, Totsuki Academy.
PRODUCER GUY: Okay, a classic fish-out-of-water story.
SCREENWRITER GUY: Exactly. And on the first day, he declares he’s going to be number one, so now everyone hates him.
PRODUCER GUY: A classic making-it-worse-for-yourself story. I like it.
SCREENWRITER GUY: So at this school, any disagreement can be settled with a high-stakes cooking duel called a “Shokugeki.”
PRODUCER GUY: A food war?
SCREENWRITER GUY: That's what it means in English, yes. Students can wager anything from cooking utensils to their entire future at the academy.
PRODUCER GUY: So you can get expelled from the school because someone made a better plate of spaghetti than you?
SCREENWRITER GUY: Super easy, barely an inconvenience.
PRODUCER GUY: Wow wow wow… wow.
SCREENWRITER GUY: And the food is so good that when the judges taste it, they have these intense, over-the-top reactions.
PRODUCER GUY: Like they say “Mmm, that’s delicious”?
SCREENWRITER GUY: More like they’re launched into a psychedelic fantasy world and their clothes explode off their bodies.
PRODUCER GUY: I’m sorry, what was that last part?
SCREENWRITER GUY: Their clothes explode off. It’s a visual metaphor for how good the food is.
PRODUCER GUY: So we’re going to have a bunch of naked old food critics on screen? That sounds a little weird.
SCREENWRITER GUY: It’s equal opportunity nakedness! Anyway, Soma starts making friends and rivals, and competes in all these crazy challenges, like a training camp from hell where hundreds of students get expelled, and a big tournament called the Autumn Elections.
PRODUCER GUY: This sounds less like a cooking show and more like a battle shonen anime. Do they shout the names of their cooking techniques?
SCREENWRITER GUY: Constantly. But then, the school gets taken over by a new headmaster, Azami Nakiri. He’s the crazy, controlling father of one of the main female characters.
PRODUCER GUY: Ah, a villain. What’s his evil plan? To poison the world’s food supply?
SCREENWRITER GUY: No, he wants to shut down any club that isn't up to his standards and force all the students to cook only his approved "gourmet" recipes. He calls his organization "Central."
PRODUCER GUY: So his evil master plan is to eliminate culinary creativity? He sounds less like a supervillain and more like a grumpy food blogger.
SCREENWRITER GUY: He’s very intimidating! So Soma and his friends form a rebel faction to fight back.
PRODUCER GUY: With what, an army?
SCREENWRITER GUY: With cooking. They challenge Central to a massive team-based Shokugeki called a Regiment de Cuisine.
PRODUCER GUY: A… cooking regiment? Is that like a food fight but with more rules?
SCREENWRITER GUY: Yes. The rebels have to fight against the Elite Ten, the best student chefs in the entire school, to win back their freedom and save everyone from a future of boring food.
PRODUCER GUY: Man, the stakes are so high I can almost taste them. And they’re probably delicious. So it must be incredibly difficult to defeat the ten best student chefs in the country who are backed by a tyrannical culinary regime.
SCREENWRITER GUY: Actually, it’s super easy, barely an inconvenience.
PRODUCER GUY: Oh, really?
SCREENWRITER GUY: Yeah, Soma and his friends just cook better than them and they win. Soma even gets the First Seat on the Elite Ten council.
PRODUCER GUY: Of course he does. Well, it’s a show about fighting with food where eating something delicious makes you lose your clothes. It’s so bizarre it’s gotta be a hit.
SCREENWRITER GUY: I thought so too, sir!
