**PRODUCER GUY:** Alright, so what do you got for me today? Another movie based on a video game? Because those usually do really well.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, no, it's a new Dragon Ball series! It's called *Dragon Ball Daima*.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, *Dragon Ball*? Okay, I'm listening. What's the big hook this time? More power levels? A new Super Saiyan transformation that's just a different color?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, we're taking it back to the roots, kind of. The main concept is that Goku and most of the Z-Fighters are turned into... children!

**PRODUCER GUY:** *Children*? Like, little kids? Didn't we already do that with *GT*?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah, but this is different! In *GT*, it was just Goku. Here, it's *everyone*! Vegeta, Piccolo, Bulma, even Dende gets de-aged into a baby!

**PRODUCER GUY:** A baby Dende? So, no one can use the Dragon Balls then, since he's too young to be Earth's guardian?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, yes, exactly! That's part of the problem. A new Demon Realm villain, King Gomah, wishes them into kids so they won't interfere with his plans.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, they're weak and stuck as little kids. How are they going to fight powerful demons? Are they just going to rely on comedic hijinks?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** There will be some humor, sure! But they'll still be strong. Kid Goku still goes Super Saiyan, even Super Saiyan 3!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wait, so he can go Super Saiyan 3 as a kid? That's... a lot. And Vegeta? Does he finally get Super Saiyan 3 too? Because fans have been wanting that for, like, forever.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Oh, absolutely! Kid Vegeta pulls off Super Saiyan 3! And get this, Goku even manages to unlock a *canonical* Super Saiyan 4!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Super Saiyan 4?! But that was from *GT*, the non-canon one! Are we just bringing back everything people liked from *GT* and making it canon? Because that's a clever way to get everyone on board.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It's a celebration of the franchise's 40th anniversary! It's got adventure, it's got action, and it takes place in the Demon Realm, which we haven't really explored much. They have to gather these new "Crystal Balls of the Universe" to turn back to normal.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So it's like original *Dragon Ball*, but with higher stakes and everybody's small. And we get to see Vegeta with a Super Saiyan 3 mullet. This could actually work. This could be a huge hit!
