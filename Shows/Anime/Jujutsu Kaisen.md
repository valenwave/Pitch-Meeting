**PRODUCER GUY:** So you have a new anime series for me?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes sir, I do! It's called *Jujutsu Kaisen*.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Sounds mystical. What's it about?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So the story follows this high school kid, Yuji Itadori, who is just ridiculously strong. Like, he can throw a shotput and accidentally break the world record.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, so he's the chosen one with a secret power?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Not exactly. He's just naturally super athletic for no real reason. Anyway, he's in the Occult Club, and one day they find a real-life cursed object: a gross old finger.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A finger? That's the ancient artifact?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It is! It's one of twenty fingers belonging to the King of Curses, a super powerful demon named Ryomen Sukuna. So these giant monsters called Curses, which are born from negative human emotions, show up to get the finger. To save his friends, Yuji does the only logical thing.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Throws the finger really far away with his super strength?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He eats it.

**PRODUCER GUY:** He does what now?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He pops that bad boy in his mouth and swallows it whole.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Why would he do that?!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** To gain its power, obviously! So now the King of Curses lives inside him, and they have little chats in his head sometimes.

**PRODUCER GUY:** I'm sure that's a perfectly healthy dynamic.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It is! So then he gets found by this organization of Jujutsu Sorcerers, who are like magic curse-fighting police. They want to execute him immediately.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Well, yeah, he's got the King of Demons inside him. That seems reasonable.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** But then the strongest sorcerer alive, Satoru Gojo, steps in. Heâ€™s this super cool, blindfolded teacher with white hair. He proposes that they let Yuji live until he finds and eats all twenty of Sukuna's fingers. Then they can execute him and get rid of Sukuna for good.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So his entire life's mission is to collect a bunch of old fingers, eat them, and then die?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly! It's very heroic. So Yuji enrolls in Jujutsu High and teams up with the stoic Megumi Fushiguro and the feisty Nobara Kugisaki.

**PRODUCER GUY:** The classic anime trio. Got it. What's this Gojo guy's deal? You said he's the strongest?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Oh, he's completely broken. He has this ability called Limitless which means nothing can physically touch him unless he allows it. He can also teleport and create black holes.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wow wow wow. So it must be really tough for him to fight bad guys.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Actually, it's super easy, barely an inconvenience.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, really?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah, he pretty much just waves his hand and entire forests get obliterated. The main villains, a group of intelligent Curses led by a guy in stitches named Mahito, basically spend the whole first season running away the second he shows up.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So why don't they just have him solve all the problems?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, he gets sent away on business trips a lot. Very important Sorcerer business. So then we get to this huge story arc called the Shibuya Incident. The villains' grand plan is to get Gojo out of the picture.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Are they going to try and fight him? Seems like a bad idea.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Even better. They trap thousands of civilians in Shibuya on Halloween and call him out. Then, after he effortlessly destroys one of the main villains, they spring their trap: a special cursed object called the Prison Realm.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A magic box.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** A magic box! All it has to do is keep Gojo's attention for one minute inside its effective range, and it seals him away.

**PRODUCER GUY:** And they succeed? They sideline their most popular and powerful character in a box?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** They sure do! And then all hell breaks loose for like, fifty chapters. It's a non-stop, city-wide battle royale. Tons of characters die horrible deaths, Sukuna gets let out to play and destroys half the city, and Yuji is left emotionally devastated. It's great!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Yikes. That sounds incredibly bleak.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It raises the stakes! And then we end on a cliffhanger where the entire country of Japan is thrown into chaos and Yuji is a wanted fugitive again.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So the good guys get completely wrecked and the story gets super depressing.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Isn't it fantastic?

**PRODUCER GUY:** I'll be honest, I'm a little confused by all the talk of Cursed Energy, Domain Expansions, and why that one guy is a talking Panda, but the action looks incredible and this Gojo character seems like he'll sell a lot of merchandise. Let's make it!
