## Death Note (Netflix Live-Action Movie)

**INT. PRODUCER GUY'S OFFICE - DAY**

PRODUCER GUY sips from a ridiculously large coffee mug. Across from him, SCREENWRITER GUY beams.

**PRODUCER GUY**
Alright, so you've got this new take on *Death Note*. Lay it on me.

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
Okay, so it's about this brilliant, but also kind of whiny, high school student. His name is Light. And he finds this supernatural notebook, the Death Note, that allows him to kill anyone just by writing their name in it.

**PRODUCER GUY**
Right. So he's like, a smart guy? A genius, even?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
Absolutely! Super smart. But also, you know, kind of a dweeb. He gets bullied.

**PRODUCER GUY**
Oh, so a relatable hero. Perfect. And what does this genius dweeb do with the power to kill anyone? Does he carefully strategize, creating a new world order in secret, playing a cat-and-mouse game with the world's greatest detective?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
Well, he writes some names in it, sure. But then he immediately shows it to this girl he has a crush on, Mia. And they go on this whole Bonnie and Clyde thing, except, you know, with a supernatural notebook and lots of screaming.

**PRODUCER GUY**
Screaming? So when this supernatural death god, Ryuk, appears, Light, the genius, just like, screams and curls up in a ball?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
Yup! It’s a very visceral reaction. Shows he's human, you know?

**PRODUCER GUY**
Right. Very human. So this all-powerful Ryuk character, the one who dropped the notebook in the first place because he was bored and wanted to see what would happen with humanity... does he have a big role in all this? Is he a cynical observer, enjoying the chaos?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
He's there! He mostly just, like, stands in the background and occasionally says something spooky. Willem Dafoe voices him though, so that's cool!

**PRODUCER GUY**
Willem Dafoe. Nice. That’s a good get. So, what about the world's greatest detective, L? Does he meticulously deduce Light's identity through brilliant mind games and intellectual traps?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
He does! He deduces that Light is in Seattle because… reasons. And he comes to America! And he, uh, also likes to eat candy.

**PRODUCER GUY**
He eats candy in the original too. But Seattle? Not, like, Japan, where the story is set?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
We Americanized it! It makes it more relatable for a global audience, obviously. And L is, like, really intense. He gets really emotional and runs around a lot.

**PRODUCER GUY**
So the calm, collected, hyper-intelligent L is now… running around and yelling?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
It’s a *different* take! It’s edgy! Also, Light’s big plan to defeat L involves, uh, a Ferris wheel. It’s very dramatic.

**PRODUCER GUY**
A Ferris wheel. Right. And does this movie, like, explore the deep philosophical questions about justice, morality, and the corrupting nature of power, like the original anime and manga?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
It’s got, uh, a few lines about changing the world! But mostly it's a teen romance with some slow-motion dance sequences and an 80s soft rock soundtrack. We really focused on Light and Mia's relationship. It's very central.

**PRODUCER GUY**
So, the complex psychological thriller about a battle of wits becomes a… high school romance with a murderous twist?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
Exactly! It's fresh! It's new! And we made the deaths really gruesome, like *Final Destination*. People love that!

**PRODUCER GUY**
(Sighs, takes a long sip of coffee)
You know what? This sounds… like it’s going to resonate with a very specific demographic. A demographic that maybe hasn't seen the original. And Willem Dafoe is pretty cool. Yeah, I think this could actually do... *surprisingly well*.
