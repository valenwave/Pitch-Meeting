## Pitch Meeting: Naruto

**INT. PRODUCER GUY'S OFFICE - DAY**

PRODUCER GUY is sitting at his desk, staring blankly at a wall. SCREENWRITER GUY bursts in, overflowing with enthusiasm.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So, I have this idea for an anime, it's called "Naruto"!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Naruto? What's a Naruto? Is it some kind of exotic fruit? Because I'm feeling like a smoothie.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, no, it's about a ninja! A young, loud, hyperactive ninja named Naruto Uzumaki!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, a ninja, eh? So, like, he's super stealthy? Blends into the shadows, a master of espionage?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, no. He's actually really bad at stealth. He's kind of an outcast in his village because he has this giant demon fox sealed inside him.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wait, a demon fox? Inside a kid? So, like, the whole village is cool with this? No one's trying to, I don't know, *exorcise* him?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, they shun him. And he doesn't even know *why* at first. He just wants to become the leader of his village, the Hokage, to gain everyone's recognition!

**PRODUCER GUY:** So he's basically a walking, talking, super-powered metaphor for wanting to be loved? Okay, I'm with you. What kind of ninja stuff does he do? Does he throw shurikens? Do cool flips?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Oh, he does all that! But his signature move is the "Sexy Jutsu," where he transforms into a naked woman. For comedic effect, you know.

**PRODUCER GUY:** ...He transforms into a naked woman. The protagonist. Who is trying to gain recognition. So he can become the leader of his village.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah! And he also has this technique where he can make hundreds of copies of himself! It's called the "Shadow Clone Jutsu"!

**PRODUCER GUY:** So he can just spam himself into an army? Wouldn't that make every fight, like, super easy?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Not always! Sometimes he runs out of chakra, which is like, his ninja energy. And he's often facing much stronger opponents! Like, there's this dude named Sasuke, who's his rival, and he's super cool and brooding and everyone loves him.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Ah, so he's the "Edward Cullen" of ninjas. Got it. And what about the girl? Is there a girl?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Oh, yes! Sakura! Naruto has a crush on her, but she's obsessed with Sasuke!

**PRODUCER GUY:** So a love triangle that goes absolutely nowhere for like, a thousand episodes? Classic! What kind of missions do these ninjas go on? Are they like, super dangerous, life-or-death situations?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Sometimes! But also, they do D-rank missions, like finding lost cats or pulling weeds.

**PRODUCER GUY:** *Pulling weeds*? For an elite ninja force? Are you serious?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Hey, a ninja's gotta start somewhere! And then things get really intense! There's a big ninja war, and ancient alien princesses, and people with super special eyes that can copy techniques!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Alien princesses? We went from a demon fox to alien princesses? How many seasons is this thing?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** A lot. And then there's "Shippuden," which is when they're teenagers! And then "Boruto," which is his son! We're gonna keep this going for *decades*!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Decades, you say? With a loud, demon-fox-hosting, sexy-jutsu-performing, weed-pulling ninja? You know what, this sounds absolutely ridiculous. It's so over-the-top and goes on forever, it just might work.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Yeah, I think this "Naruto" thing is gonna do okay.
