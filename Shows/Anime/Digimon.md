**PRODUCER GUY:** So, you got a movie for me?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes sir, I do. It’s about a group of kids who get digital monsters.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Digital monsters, huh? So it’s like Pokémon?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No! Well, I mean, they're both about monsters, but in this one the monsters can talk!

**PRODUCER GUY:** So they’re like Pokémon with dialogue.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** And they can digivolve!

**PRODUCER GUY:** What is a digivolve?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It's like evolving, but with "digi" at the beginning. It makes them bigger and stronger.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So bigger Pokémon with dialogue. Got it.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So the movie opens on seven kids at summer camp when suddenly these little devices fall out of the sky.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Mysterious sky devices are tight!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Then, a giant wave sweeps them up and transports them to the Digital World!

**PRODUCER GUY:** A whole other world? That sounds dangerous for a bunch of summer campers.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It is! But it’s okay, because they immediately meet their partner Digimon who have been waiting for them.

**PRODUCER GUY:** How convenient. What are these kids' special skills? Are they monster trainers? Tech geniuses?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Not really. One of them is a soccer player, one is a "computer boy," and another is kind of a pampered princess. But they're the DigiDestined, chosen to save this world.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So a random group of kids with zero survival skills are the chosen ones. Super easy, barely an inconvenience.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly. So they start exploring and find out about these Black Gears that an evil Digimon named Devimon is using to turn good Digimon bad.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Why not just destroy them? Why go through the trouble of corrupting them?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Because he’s evil and it’s a more elaborate plan! So the kids have to fight these corrupted Digimon, and when things get tough, their partners digivolve. For instance, the main kid Tai has this little orange dinosaur named Agumon, and he digivolves into Greymon, a giant T-Rex!

**PRODUCER GUY:** A giant T-Rex sounds expensive. Couldn't he just digivolve into a slightly bigger, slightly angrier lizard?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** But the T-Rex is iconic! So after fighting a bunch of Devimon’s minions, including a lion-man and a snowman, they finally face the big bad himself.

**PRODUCER GUY:** And Greymon takes him out with his T-Rex power?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Not quite. Devimon is too strong. All the Digimon are defeated, except for T.K.'s little partner, Patamon, who hasn't been able to digivolve the whole movie.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, so the weakest one is the key? I love that trope.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yup! Patamon digivolves into Angemon, an angel Digimon, and sacrifices himself to defeat Devimon.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Whoa, one of the main characters dies? That’s pretty dark for a kid’s movie.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Oh, don't worry. He just turns back into an egg. He’ll be fine.

**PRODUCER GUY:** He turns into an egg? What’s the point of the sacrifice then?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It’s symbolic! Because they’re digital, they just get reborn. It’s fine.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, no real stakes. Fantastic. So the movie ends there?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Not quite! After Devimon is gone, a mysterious old man named Gennai appears as a hologram and tells them they have to go to a whole new continent to fight an even stronger bad guy.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So it's basically a feature-length trailer for the next movie.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Think of it as world-building! It sets up the whole franchise!

**PRODUCER GUY:** A franchise based on talking, egg-reverting Pokémon knockoffs? I don’t know.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** But sir, think of the merchandise! The toys that digivolve, the little digital pet devices, the video games...

**PRODUCER GUY:** The merchandise... You know what? This sounds like a gold mine. People are going to eat this up.
