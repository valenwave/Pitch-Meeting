**PRODUCER GUY:** So, you have an anime series for me?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes sir, I do! So, the show opens and a mysterious green light flashes across the entire globe.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Ooh, mysterious. What does it do?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It instantly turns every single human on Earth into a stone statue.

**PRODUCER GUY:** The entire planet? All at once?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Every last one. And then we jump forward 3,700 years.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wow wow wow... wow. So everybody's dead and it's a show about rocks.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Not quite! See, one day, a teenage super-genius named Senku Ishigami just sort of... breaks free from the stone.

**PRODUCER GUY:** How did he manage that?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** By thinking really, really hard. Also, he stayed conscious for all 3,700 years by counting every single second to keep his mind from eroding.

**PRODUCER GUY:** He counted for thousands of years in stone form and didn't go completely insane?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He’s very dedicated to the scientific method. So he wakes up in this new "Stone World" where civilization is gone, and his first goal is to figure out how to revive everyone else.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Okay, that seems like a difficult problem to solve when your only resources are sticks and stones.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Actually, it's super easy, barely an inconvenience.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, really?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah, he figures out that nitric acid, which he can get from bat guano, mixed with alcohol will dissolve the stone and bring people back. He calls it the revival fluid.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Science made from bat poop is tight!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So he first revives his big, strong, simple-minded friend Taiju. But then they're immediately cornered by a pack of lions.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh no! They just came back to life after a 3,700-year nap and now they're going to be cat food. It’s going to be tough to get out of that.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Super easy, barely an inconvenience! They decide to use their last bit of revival fluid on a statue of the strongest guy they know, a martial artist called "The Strongest High School Primate," Shishio Tsukasa.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wait, their plan to deal with a life-threatening situation is to revive a complete stranger who is famous for being dangerously strong?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** That's the one! And it works perfectly! He wakes up and kills all the lions with one punch.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Great. So now they have a super-strong ally who will definitely not have his own conflicting and terrifying ideology.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well about that. Tsukasa decides the old world was corrupt, so he wants to build a new world populated only by the young and pure of heart. Which means he starts smashing the statues of all the adults.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So his plan is just mass murder.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It’s a very philosophical mass murder! So Senku wants to revive everyone with science and Tsukasa wants to commit statue-cide, which leads to conflict, and Tsukasa seemingly kills Senku by breaking his neck.

**PRODUCER GUY:** He killed the main character right at the beginning? Bold.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Not exactly. See, a little piece of stone left on Senku’s neck acted like a brace, so when his friends use the revival fluid on him later, he’s totally fine.

**PRODUCER GUY:** That seems medically questionable but narratively convenient.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Ten billion percent convenient! So Senku splits off and finds a whole village of people who were never petrified.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Hold the phone. I thought you said *everyone* on Earth was turned to stone.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** They were! These villagers are the descendants of six astronauts who were on the International Space Station when the green light hit. They came back down and restarted humanity.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, of course. The only people who weren't on Earth were safe. I guess that makes sense.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It does! So Senku decides he needs to win these villagers over to form a Kingdom of Science. He starts by inventing ramen from scratch to impress them.

**PRODUCER GUY:** He’s building an army using instant noodles?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** The path to scientific progress is paved with delicious broth. His main goal becomes creating a sulfa drug—an antibiotic—to cure the village priestess of pneumonia. To do that, he needs to invent iron, then magnets, then a water wheel generator for electricity, then lightbulbs, then glass, then sulfuric acid...

**PRODUCER GUY:** So the show is just a giant, ridiculous crafting tree from a video game.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly! And to fight Tsukasa, who is building his own empire, Senku decides the Kingdom of Science needs the ultimate scientific weapon.

**PRODUCER GUY:** What, like a gun? A cannon?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Cell phones.

**PRODUCER GUY:** He's going to make... cell phones. In the stone world. From basically nothing.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So they can coordinate their attack. It’s the only logical next step!

**PRODUCER GUY:** You know what, at this point I'm fully on board. A kid who can count for 37 centuries can probably make an iPhone out of some grass and a cave. It sounds absolutely ridiculous, but I bet people who like learning things will be ten billion percent into it.
