**PRODUCER GUY:** So, you have a show for me?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes, sir, I do! It’s called *Devs*.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Okay, *Devs*. What's it about?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So, it's about this super-secret division in a tech company. And they’re, like, doing something really groundbreaking with quantum computing.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Okay, quantum computing. Is it going to be like *The Social Network* but with more… quantum?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, it's got a much darker, more philosophical tone. It’s about determinism versus free will.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Determinism versus free will. So… it’s going to be a real upbeat, fun show then. Great for family night.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It’s actually quite serious. The main character, Lily, her boyfriend gets involved with this secret division, and then he goes missing. And she suspects foul play.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, it’s a mystery. With quantum computing. And determinism. And free will. And a missing boyfriend. Sounds like we’re trying to fit a lot of things in there. Is it going to be, like, super action-packed? With explosions and car chases?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Not really. It’s more atmospheric. Lots of long, contemplative shots. And the headquarters of the company is this really striking, brutalist building in the middle of a forest.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, a brutalist building in a forest. So, it’s like a nature documentary about concrete.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, it’s… it’s very visually distinct. And the leader of the company, Forest, he’s this almost mystical figure. And he believes the quantum computer can perfectly predict the future. Or replay the past.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, he’s got a super computer that can do… anything. That sounds pretty powerful. What’s the downside?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, if everything is predetermined, then there’s no free will. And that has some pretty significant implications. For… everything.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Uh huh. And what about the ending? Does it all tie up nicely? Is there a big showdown where the good guys win and the bad guys lose?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, Lily ends up in a simulation, and then she dies in the real world, and then she’s brought back in the simulation, and she's with her boyfriend, and they’re just, like, existing in this perfect, pre-determined world.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, they’re just hanging out in a computer program? Sounds… exciting. Is there, like, a big battle with a robot or something?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, it’s more about the philosophical implications of their existence. And the idea that even in a simulated reality, they’re still living a life.

**PRODUCER GUY:** You know what? I think this has real potential. People love thinking about determinism and existential dread. This is going to be a huge hit.
