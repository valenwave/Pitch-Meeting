**PRODUCER GUY:** So, you have a new crime drama for me?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes sir, I do! It's about a serial killer!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Okay, a show from the killer's point of view. It’s been done, but it can be dark and gritty. I’m listening.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Right, but get this: he's the hero!

**PRODUCER GUY:** The serial killer is the hero of the story?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly! See, he’s a good guy deep down, because he only kills *other* bad people. Murderers, criminals, people who escaped the justice system. He’s a vigilante!

**PRODUCER GUY:** A vigilante serial killer. So what’s his day job?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He’s a blood spatter analyst for the Miami Metro Police Department.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wow wow wow… wow. So the serial killer who kills killers works for the police department that hunts serial killers?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It’s the perfect cover! He gets access to all the police files and crime scenes to find his next victim. His name is Dexter, by the way.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Isn't someone going to notice that the guy who’s an expert on murder scenes seems to be creating a lot of them on the side?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Not at all! He’s very neat. His adoptive father, who was a cop, found out about his urges when he was a kid and taught him a special "Code" on how to kill people without getting caught.

**PRODUCER GUY:** His cop dad taught him how to be a better serial killer? That’s some questionable parenting.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It’s a very touching father-son story, sir. Anyway, his sister, Deb, is also a cop at the same precinct. She’s trying to become a homicide detective.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, so the whole family is in law enforcement, except for the one who secretly moonlights as a murderer.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Right! And she’s constantly asking Dexter for his expert opinion on her cases, which are sometimes the very cases he’s involved in! And for the first season, the main villain is the "Ice Truck Killer," and wouldn't you know it, Deb starts dating him!

**PRODUCER GUY:** So his cop sister starts dating the serial killer that he, the other serial killer, is secretly hunting? What are the odds?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It gets even crazier! The Ice Truck Killer is actually Dexter’s long-lost biological brother!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh my God. So all of Miami’s serial killer problems are just one big family reunion.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Pretty much! And to remember all his good deeds, Dexter keeps a little trophy from each victim: a single drop of their blood on a glass slide, which he keeps in a box hidden inside his air conditioner.

**PRODUCER GUY:** He keeps a collection of DNA evidence from all of his murders in his own apartment? That seems like a staggeringly bad idea.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It’s his little arts and crafts project! Anyway, at one point his boss, Lieutenant LaGuerta, gets extremely suspicious of him. She's convinced he's the "Bay Harbor Butcher."

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh no! It’s going to be tough to get out of that one. His boss is onto him and she’s got evidence!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Actually, it's going to be super easy, barely an inconvenience.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, really?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah, he just manages to pin all of his murders on his colleague, Sergeant Doakes, who conveniently dies in an explosion. Everyone in the police department just kind of accepts it.

**PRODUCER GUY:** The entire Miami police force was fooled into thinking their decorated sergeant was a serial killer?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He yelled a lot, so it seemed plausible. But then things get really bad when another killer, the Trinity Killer, figures out who Dexter is and murders his wife, Rita!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, wow. So he finally has to face some real, tragic consequences for his lifestyle.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** For like, an episode. Then he just hires a nanny for his son and keeps on killing people. Anyway, after several more seasons of this, he finally gets cornered. His sister is dying, the cops are closing in, and he sails his boat directly into a hurricane.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A tragic, yet poetic, end for a killer. Consumed by the storm within.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Nope. He fakes his death, abandons his young son, and moves to Oregon to become a lumberjack.

**PRODUCER GUY:** He becomes a… what?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** A lumberjack. With a big beard. The end.

**PRODUCER GUY:** That sounds like an ending that will make people so angry they’ll talk about it for a decade.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** They will! Which is why, ten years later, we bring him back for a new series!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Of course you do.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So now he’s living in a small, snowy town in upstate New York, his name is Jim, and he hasn't killed anyone in years.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So he’s finally found peace.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** For about five minutes. Then his son, Harrison, now a teenager, finds him.

**PRODUCER GUY:** The kid he abandoned? I bet that was an awkward conversation.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Super awkward! And it immediately makes Dexter want to start killing again. So he does! And then his girlfriend, who is the town's Chief of Police, starts getting suspicious.

**PRODUCER GUY:** This guy really has a type.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It's a real problem for him. So in the end, she figures it all out and is about to arrest him, but he gets away and tells his son to shoot him with a rifle.

**PRODUCER GUY:** He has his own son murder him?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He does! To put him out of his misery. Then Harrison runs off into the woods. The end, for real this time, we promise.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So we made people wait ten years just to give them an ending that might be even more controversial than the lumberjack one.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** That’s the vision!

**PRODUCER GUY:** A likable serial killer who works for the police and has two of the most divisive finales in television history… I think it’s going to be a huge hit.
