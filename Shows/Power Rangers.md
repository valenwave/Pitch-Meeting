**PRODUCER GUY:** So, you've got a new movie pitch for me? What is it?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Power Rangers.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, wow. Power Rangers. So, like, the colorful teenagers who fight rubber monsters and giant robots? That Power Rangers?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, yes, but this is a *gritty reboot*. It's a grounded, character-driven origin story.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Gritty? So, like, they're not just gonna, like, do cool karate kicks and then summon a dinosaur robot?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, no. They're troubled teens. Real problems. One's on house arrest for a failed prank. Another one's in detention for cyberbullying.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Cyberbullying? So, like, is their villain gonna be some kind of, like, internet troll with a big keyboard?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, it's Rita Repulsa. But she's, like, super ancient and she's collecting gold to raise Goldar.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Gold? So, she's like a gold miner now? Is she gonna have, like, a tiny pickaxe?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, she's, like, *eating* gold. And then she creates Goldar out of gold.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, she's got, like, a severe case of pica? That'sâ€¦ interesting. So, these troubled teens, they find these power coins, right? And they get powers.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes! They get superpowers! But they can't morph right away. They have to, like, bond first. They have to understand teamwork and friendship.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, like a superhero *Breakfast Club*? Are they gonna have a dance scene at the end?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, they do train against these rock monsters called Putties. But they're not very good at it at first. And then, at one point, Rita actually *kills* one of them.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Whoa, whoa, whoa. Kills a Power Ranger? Like, *dead* dead? Like, permanent lights out?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes, but then they bring him back. Because they learn to bond, and that unlocks the Morphing Grid.

**PRODUCER GUY:** The Morphing Grid. Is that, like, the Wi-Fi for their powers? Do they need a strong signal to morph?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It's the life force of planets! And it brings him back! And then they finally get their suits, and they summon the Zords. And the Zords combine into the Megazord!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Okay, okay. So, it takes like, 90 minutes to get to the giant robots. Is the Megazord gonna be, like, super detailed and gritty, or still just a big dinosaur robot?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It's a big robot, but it's, like, a *cool* robot. And then Rita merges with Goldar, and they fight the Megazord, and the Megazord just, like, slaps Rita into space.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Slaps her into space? Not, like, a powerful punch or a laser beam? Just a good old-fashioned slap?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** A powerful slap! It's a climatic moment! And then they go back to their regular lives, but they still have their powers. And there's a mid-credits scene with Tommy.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, the Green Ranger? So, you're setting up a sequel, then? That's a bold move for a movie where the main villains are a gold-eating witch and her slapped-into-space monster. But you know what? I think it might just work. People love nostalgia, and they love troubled teens.
