**PRODUCER GUY:** So, what's the pitch?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Okay, so it's a show about a bunch of financially desperate people who get invited to play children's games for a massive cash prize.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, so like, "Minute to Win It" but with more zeros on the check?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, yes, but also no. If you lose the game... you die.

**PRODUCER GUY:** ...You die? So it's "Minute to Win It" meets "Saw"?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** More or less! But it's South Korean. And it's a social commentary on capitalism.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A social commentary? So people are going to watch it to feel bad about society, but also be entertained by watching people get brutally murdered while playing Red Light, Green Light?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly! We start with this guy, Gi-hun, he's a total gambling addict, struggling to even see his daughter. He gets recruited by a mysterious man in a suit to play a game of Ddakji, which is like, paper-flipping. If he loses, he gets slapped.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Slapped? That's not very deadly. Are we sure about the "you die" part?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Oh, the slaps are just to get him in the door. Then he wakes up in this big dorm with 455 other people, all in green tracksuits, all in massive debt. And they're all referred to by numbers.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Numbers, you say? Like, a subtle way of dehumanizing them, even though they're already, you know, being forced into a death game?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Nailed it! And the first game is Red Light, Green Light. They have this giant creepy doll that scans for movement. If you move when she says "Red Light," you get shot.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Shot. So, like, a *lot* of people die in the first ten minutes. That's a bold move. Are we worried about viewer retention?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Not at all! It establishes the stakes immediately. Then, get this, after the first game, they actually vote to leave! And they do!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wait, so they can just... leave? From the deadly death games?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, yes, but then they go back to their horrible, debt-ridden lives, and realize that the games, as horrific as they are, offer the only real hope for survival. So most of them come back.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So it's a story about the illusion of choice in a capitalist society? That's... surprisingly poignant for a show with a giant murderous doll.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** And then there's the Dalgona game, where they have to cut out shapes from honeycomb candy. And Tug of War where they're literally pulling each other to their deaths. And a marble game where friends have to betray each other.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So it's basically designed to be as emotionally devastating as possible, while also having aesthetically pleasing, brightly colored sets.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** You're getting it! And there's a police detective who infiltrates the whole operation to find his missing brother.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, a B-plot! And a mystery! Will his brother be, like, one of the guards in the pink jumpsuits? Or maybe even... gasp... the Front Man?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** *Wink.* And the big twist at the end is that the old man, Player 001, the one Gi-hun befriended, he's actually the mastermind behind the whole thing! He's just playing for fun because he's rich and bored.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So the whole thing is just a rich guy's hobby? That's... dark. Very dark. I like it. This is going to be big. A real global phenomenon.
