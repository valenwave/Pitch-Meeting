**PRODUCER GUY:** So, what have you got for me today?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Okay, so it’s a kids’ show. And it’s about a girl named Gabby.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Gabby, huh? Is she, like, a detective? A superhero? A junior CEO of a lemonade stand empire?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, no. She’s just a girl who loves cats and dollhouses.

**PRODUCER GUY:** *Just* a girl? So, no superpowers? No secret identity? How are we gonna sell toys with that?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, she has these magical cat ears. When she puts them on and pinches them, she shrinks down and can go *inside* her dollhouse!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Okay, okay, that’s a little better. She shrinks. Does she get, like, a tiny car or something?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, the dollhouse is full of cat characters. Like Pandy Paws, who’s half panda, half cat. And Cakey Cat, who’s a cupcake with cat ears.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, she shrinks, and then she goes into a world populated by a bunch of… hybrid cat creatures?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly! There’s MerCat, who’s a mermaid cat and does spa science. And DJ Catnip, who’s a DJ cat.

**PRODUCER GUY:** DJ Catnip. Right. So, every episode, Gabby gets a "Dollhouse Delivery" from her "Meow-Meow Mailbox." And inside is a miniature package that kicks off the adventure.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** You got it! It’s like an unboxing video, but for a story! We lean into that unboxing trend kids love on YouTube.

**PRODUCER GUY:** An unboxing… of a story. So, instead of getting a cool new toy to play with in real life, she gets a *reason* to go into her dollhouse and play with *imaginary* toys?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, they’re not imaginary *to her*. And the show is all about problem-solving and a "growth mindset." Like, it’s okay to make mistakes, you just keep trying. They even say they “fail fantastically.”

**PRODUCER GUY:** “Fail fantastically.” I see. So, she’ll be trying to bake a cake with Cakey Cat, and it’ll turn into a giant balloon, and they’ll be like, “Oopsies! Let’s learn from that!”?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Precisely! And every episode, there's a new song, and maybe a craft they can do. And at the end, it goes back to live-action Gabby, and she wraps it up.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, we’re selling cat ears, dollhouses, and a belief system. And it's for preschoolers?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes! It's bright, it's colorful, it's positive. And kids love cats!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Okay, okay, I get it. Tiny girl, cat hybrids, unboxing adventures, and a whole lot of positivity. It sounds… undeniably wholesome.

**PRODUCER GUY:** You know what? This just might work. Kids love bright colors and talking animals. And if it teaches them that it's okay to mess up, well, maybe their parents will be on board too. I have a feeling this show is going to be purr-fectly successful.
