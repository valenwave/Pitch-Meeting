## Pitch Meeting: Blue's Clues

**INT. PRODUCER GUY'S OFFICE - DAY**

PRODUCER GUY sips from a ridiculously oversized coffee mug. SCREENWRITER GUY sits across from him, looking a little too eager.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So, I've got this idea for a new kids' show. It's revolutionary, really.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, really? Another talking animal show? Because we're just drowning in those. I need something that breaks the mold, something… *interactive*.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Precisely! This is interactive. It's called *Blue's Clues*.

**PRODUCER GUY:** *Blue's Clues*? Is Blue some kind of detective? Like a tiny, blue Sherlock Holmes?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, she's a blue puppy, and she leaves paw prints. Three of them, specifically. And then our host, a human guy named Steve—

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wait, a human host? In a cartoon world? How does that even work? Is he, like, a wizard? Did he get shrunk? Did he accidentally wander into a children's book convention and just stay there?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, no, he just… lives there. And he helps the kids at home figure out what Blue wants to do by finding these clues. See, Blue barks, and Steve just *knows* what she's trying to say.

**PRODUCER GUY:** He *knows*? He just… understands dog barks? So, is he a dog whisperer? Is this, like, a secret government program to train human-dog communicators for, I don't know, national security?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, he just... understands her. And then he asks the kids, "What do you think Blue wants to do?" And then he pauses, for a really long time, waiting for them to answer.

**PRODUCER GUY:** He just *waits*? In silence? On television? Do you know how much money we pay for every second of airtime? Are we just going to have, like, five seconds of dead air while some kid in their living room yells at their TV? That's not good television! That's just… a guy staring blankly!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** But that's the *interactive* part! It encourages active participation! And then, when they find all three clues, he goes to his "Thinking Chair"—

**PRODUCER GUY:** The "Thinking Chair." Is it a special chair? Does it, like, glow? Or levitate? Does it give him superpowers of thought?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It's just... a chair. And he sits in it and looks at his Handy Dandy Notebook, where he draws the clues.

**PRODUCER GUY:** He *draws* them? So, it's a show about a guy who can understand dog barks, lives in a cartoon world, and draws pictures of clues in a notebook to solve mysteries that a blue dog initiated? Is the dog, like, a master manipulator? Is she just messing with him? Does she *want* him to figure out her intentions, or is she just leaving random paw prints?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** She's just playing a game! And then they sing the "Blues Clues Song," and the "Skidoo Song," where they jump into different animated worlds!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wait, they *skidoo*? Is that like a portal? Is there a secret interdimensional travel agency in this house? Does Mailbox also skidoo? Because he just pops up through the window with the mail. Is he, like, a postal ninja?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It's just a fun way to go to different places! And there are other characters, too! Like Mr. Salt and Mrs. Pepper, who are salt and pepper shakers with babies—

**PRODUCER GUY:** Salt and pepper shakers with *babies*? Are they, like, sentient condiments? Do they have jobs? Are they unionized? This is getting pretty wild, even for a kids' show.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** And Mailbox! He's always there with a letter!

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, a daily mail delivery. In a house where a human lives with talking objects and a dog who communicates through paw prints. Is the mail, like, important? Is it top-secret government intel about the dog whisperer program?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It's just a letter! It's educational! We teach kids about shapes and colors and problem-solving!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Okay, okay, I get it. A human dude, a blue dog who leaves paw prints, talking condiments, a ninja mailbox, and lots of pausing for kids to yell at their TV. You know what? This is so bizarre, it just might work. Kids love weird. They really, *really* love weird.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Yeah, this is gonna be huge. Kids are going to eat this up. They'll be begging their parents for Handy Dandy Notebooks and staring at their dogs for clues. Mark my words.
