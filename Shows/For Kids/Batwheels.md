## Pitch Meeting: Batwheels

**INT. STUDIO EXECUTIVE'S OFFICE - DAY**

PRODUCER GUY is sitting at his desk, staring blankly at a wall. SCREENWRITER GUY bursts in, overflowing with enthusiasm.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So, I have this idea for a new Batman show!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, *another* one? We’ve got, like, seven going on right now. Is this one dark and gritty? Is he going through an existential crisis? Is he fighting a new, even more obscure villain that only three comic book readers know about?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, no, it's for kids! Preschoolers, even!

**PRODUCER GUY:** (Raises an eyebrow) Preschoolers? So, like, "Batman teaches the alphabet"? Or "Bruce Wayne learns to share his toys"?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Better! Get this: the Bat-Family's vehicles... they're sentient! They talk! They fight crime themselves!

**PRODUCER GUY:** (Leans back in his chair, intrigued) Whoa, whoa, whoa. So, the Batmobile… it talks? Like, in a friendly voice? Not like, "I am the night, and my exhaust pipe is leaking"?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly! His name is Bam, and he's the leader. Then there's Bibi, Batgirl's motorcycle, who's super fast, and Redbird, Robin's car, who's the youngest. Oh, and Buff, the Bat-Truck, who's really strong, and Batwing, the Bat-plane, who can be a bit of a diva!

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, it's like *Cars*, but with capes?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Pretty much! But with the DC universe! They’re brought to life by the Batcomputer, see, to help Batman, Robin, and Batgirl fight bad guys like Joker, Penguin, and Mr. Freeze. Except, it's the villains' vehicles they're fighting!

**PRODUCER GUY:** The villains' *vehicles* also talk and fight? So, Joker has a talking car? Does it tell riddles or something?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, the Riddler has a talking helicopter named Quizz! And Harley Quinn has an ATV named Jestah! And Penguin has a Ducky Boat named Ducky! It's all very cute and age-appropriate! They even learn life lessons about teamwork and friendship!

**PRODUCER GUY:** (Nods slowly) So, instead of Batman punching a guy, it's the Batmobile ramming a duck boat? Is there, like, a moral at the end? "Today, Bam learned that it's okay to ask for help, even if you're the world's most advanced crime-fighting vehicle"?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Pretty much! And the animation is vibrant CGI! It's going to be a hit with the little ones! Think of the toy line! Every kid will want their own talking Bat-vehicle!

**PRODUCER GUY:** (Strokes his chin thoughtfully) Talking vehicles, life lessons, existing IP… this actually has some potential. It's so… *innocent*. Nobody's expecting Batman's car to have feelings, you know? It's subversive! I like it! Yeah, this could do well. This could do *really* well.
