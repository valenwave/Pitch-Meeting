*Producer Guy walks into the office, adjusts his tie, and sips his ridiculously oversized coffee mug.*

**Producer Guy:** So, what do you got for me today, Screenwriter Guy? I've been told it's… *he checks a note on his hand*… an animated series about a kid with a football-shaped head?

**Screenwriter Guy:** That's right, Producer Guy! It's called **Hey Arnold!** It's about a fourth-grader named Arnold who lives in a boarding house with his grandparents and a bunch of quirky tenants in the big city.

**Producer Guy:** A boarding house? So, like, a whole bunch of random people living together? And he's just a kid? Is this a drama about urban decay?

**Screenwriter Guy:** Well, not exactly. It's more about his everyday life, his friendships, and how he helps solve problems for the people around him. He's kind of a natural problem-solver, a bit of an optimist.

**Producer Guy:** Okay, so he's a tiny, football-headed therapist for eccentric adults. Got it. And what kind of problems are we talking about here? Big, world-ending stuff? Or like, "Mr. Hyunh can't find his remote" kind of problems?

**Screenwriter Guy:** More like the latter. Like, in one episode, he helps Mr. Hyunh reconnect with his long-lost daughter. Or in another, he helps his best friend Gerald track down a legendary stuck piece of gum.

**Producer Guy:** A stuck piece of gum. Riveting. So, what's the big hook? What makes this kid stand out from all the other cartoon kids running around? Is he, like, secretly a superhero? Does he have a talking animal sidekick?

**Screenwriter Guy:** He has a secret admirer! This girl, Helga, who bullies him constantly, but secretly she's completely obsessed with him. She has a shrine to him in her closet made out of chewing gum!

**Producer Guy:** Wait, wait, wait. So this girl is verbally abusive to him, but she's also in love with him? That sounds… unhealthy. And she has a shrine made of *chewing gum*? Is this a show for kids or a psychological thriller?

**Screenwriter Guy:** It's supposed to be funny! It's her way of expressing herself! And it's a big city, so we can explore all sorts of urban legends and unique characters. Like the Stoop Kid, who's afraid to leave his stoop!

**Producer Guy:** The Stoop Kid. So, a guy who just sits on his porch all day. I'm starting to think this "big city" you're talking about is actually just a collection of very specific, highly immobile people. So, what, he solves the Stoop Kid's fear of leaving his stoop?

**Screenwriter Guy:** Eventually, yes! He helps him overcome his fears and face the world!

**Producer Guy:** So, a football-headed kid is solving everyone's deep-seated psychological issues. And a girl who worships him with chewed gum. You know what, Screenwriter Guy? This is so bizarre, it just might work. People love weird. They love wholesome. And they definitely love a good urban legend. This sounds like a sleeper hit.
