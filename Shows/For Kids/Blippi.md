**INT. STUDIO EXECUTIVE'S OFFICE - DAY**

PRODUCER GUY sits across from SCREENWRITER GUY, who is practically vibrating with excitement.

**PRODUCER GUY**
Alright, so what's the big pitch today? Something groundbreaking? A gritty reboot of a classic?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
Even better, sir! It's for preschoolers!

Producer Guy blinks.

**PRODUCER GUY**
...Okay. Go on.

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
So, it's about this guy, Blippi! He wears a bright orange and blue outfit, suspenders, a bowtie, goofy glasses, and a cap! And he travels around, visiting places, asking questions, and explaining concepts directly to the kids!

**PRODUCER GUY**
So, like, an over-caffeinated Mr. Rogers with a penchant for primary colors?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
Precisely! He'll go to a fire station, and he'll explain how a firetruck works! "Vroom, vroom! Look at that siren, kids! Woo-woo-woo!" And then he'll visit a farm and talk about the animals! "Moo! That's a cow, kids! And it makes milk!"

**PRODUCER GUY**
So, basic concepts for very, very small children. Got it. And the character? Is he, like, a veteran educator? A puppeteer?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
He's… an Air Force veteran named Stevin John! And before this, he was making, uh, other kinds of videos. For adults.

Producer Guy raises an eyebrow.

**PRODUCER GUY**
"Other kinds of videos," you say? Anything we should be aware of? Like, is he known for, uh, *exploratory performance art*?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
Well, there was this one viral video, it was called the "Harlem Shake Poop." He, uh, he defecated on a friend.

Silence. Producer Guy stares, unblinking.

**PRODUCER GUY**
He *what* now?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
Yeah, he apologized for it! Said it was "gross-out comedy" from his early twenties. Long before Blippi!

**PRODUCER GUY**
So, our wholesome children's entertainer has a, shall we say, *colorful* past involving fecal matter and viral dance crazes. Fantastic. And we just… ignore that?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
Well, the kids won't know! And parents… well, they'll probably just be happy their kids are quiet for five minutes! Plus, he's got this super energetic, almost manic style. He'll jump around, make funny noises, spell out his name really slowly to drill in the brand…

**PRODUCER GUY**
"Drill in the brand." I like that. So, he's basically a walking, talking, highly marketable toy commercial.

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
He will eventually have a *ton* of merchandise, yes! Toys, books, clothes, live shows where he doesn't always perform himself but has other actors...

**PRODUCER GUY**
Wait, he won't even show up to his own live shows sometimes? He'll just send a stand-in?

**SCREENWRITER GUY**
It's, uh, it's a *brand extension*! A diverse portfolio of Blippi experiences! And he'll even visit factories, calling them "apple factories" and "raspberry factories" rather than, you know, orchards. And he'll visit animals in zoos and farms and mostly talk about how much they weigh. It's about the *things*, sir! The vehicles, the places, the *stuff*!

Producer Guy leans back, a slow smile spreading across his face.

**PRODUCER GUY**
You know what, I like it. It's loud, it's repetitive, it's in-your-face, and it requires almost no critical thinking from the viewer. The parents will be annoyed, but the kids will be absolutely captivated. This is genius. Absolute genius. I predict this will be a massive hit with the toddler demographic.
