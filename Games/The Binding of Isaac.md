**PRODUCER GUY:** So, you got a new video game for me?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes sir, I do. It’s a charming little top-down adventure game, kind of like the original *Legend of Zelda*.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, I like that! A classic formula. What’s it called?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It’s called *The Binding of Isaac*!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Okay, a little biblical reference. Sounds wholesome. What’s the story?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So, we’ve got this little kid, Isaac, who lives in a house on a hill with his mom. He’s just a happy kid, drawing and playing with his toys.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Adorable.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** But his mom is super religious and one day she hears a voice from above that she thinks is God.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh boy.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** And this voice tells her that her son Isaac is corrupted by sin and she needs to take away all his toys. So she does.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wow wow wow… wow. That’s a little harsh.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Then the voice tells her to lock him in his room to protect him from the evil of the world. So she does that too.

**PRODUCER GUY:** That’s just straight-up child abuse.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Then the voice says, "You’ve done well, but I question your devotion. To prove your faith, sacrifice your son." So she grabs a butcher’s knife from the kitchen to go kill him.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh my god! What is this game?!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So Isaac, in a panic, finds a trapdoor in his floor and escapes into the basement.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A basement filled with spiders and rats, I assume.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** And monsters, walking clumps of flesh, demons, and the literal manifestations of the Seven Deadly Sins.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Of course. So he finds a sword or a cool weapon down there to fight them?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He fights them by crying.

**PRODUCER GUY:** I’m sorry, what?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He shoots his tears out of his eyes and uses them as projectiles to kill the monsters.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Weaponized childhood trauma is tight.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It is! And as he explores the procedurally generated dungeons of his basement, he finds all sorts of amazing power-ups!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Like what? A cool helmet? A magic shield?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** More like "Mom's Knife," which he can throw, a "Dead Cat" that gives him nine lives, or "Brimstone," which lets him shoot a powerful laser beam out of his mouth.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A mouth laser? Okay, that's kind of cool, I guess.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** And all the items change his appearance! So by the end of a run, he might be a flying demon boy with a coat hanger sticking through his head, multiple eyes, and a giant tumor for a sidekick.

**PRODUCER GUY:** This sounds like a fever dream a child would have after eating too much cheese.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly! So eventually he fights his way through the depths of the basement and has to face the ultimate boss.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Let me guess, Satan?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** His mom.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh my god. So he has to fight a giant, stomping version of his own mother who is actively trying to murder him. Yikes. It’s going to be tough to defeat his own mom.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Actually, it’s going to be super easy, barely an inconvenience.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, really?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah, he just cries on her giant leg for a bit, and then if he has the right item, The Bible just falls out of the sky and crushes her instantly.

**PRODUCER GUY:** The book just… kills her.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It does! And that’s just the first ending. After that he can fight her heart, and then go on to fight himself, Satan, and a being called Delirium which is basically a giant, glitching skull monster representing his dying mind.

**PRODUCER GUY:** His *dying* mind? So he dies?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It's heavily implied the whole game is taking place in his mind as he suffocates inside a toy chest he locked himself in to hide from his mother.

**PRODUCER GUY:** What?!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah! The whole thing is a metaphor for trauma, religious fanaticism, and a broken home! What do you think?

**PRODUCER GUY:** A game about a crying, naked child fighting poop monsters and his abusive mother in a basement that’s really a metaphor for him dying of suffocation? This is the most disturbing thing I have ever heard. No one is going to play this. It's too dark, too weird, and frankly, too depressing.
