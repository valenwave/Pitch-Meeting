**PRODUCER GUY:** So, what do you got for me?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Okay, so it’s a visual novel game, right? But it’s also a murder mystery. And a dating sim. And a rhythm game.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Woah woah woah. Hold on. All of those things? In one game?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah! It’s called Danganronpa. So, we have these elite high school students, they’re all the "Ultimate" at something – like the Ultimate Pop Star, Ultimate Programmer, Ultimate Fashionista...

**PRODUCER GUY:** And what’s their deal? They’re like, going to a cool school to hone their talents?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, no. They’re trapped in the school. By a robotic teddy bear named Monokuma.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A robotic teddy bear.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes. And he tells them that the only way to escape is to murder another student and then get away with it.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Get away with it how? They just… leave?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, they have to go through a class trial. If they successfully pin the murder on someone else, then they graduate and everyone else dies. But if the class figures out who the actual killer is, then only the killer gets executed.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, the stakes are pretty high.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Oh, the stakes are *wild*. And the executions are… well, they’re very specific to the Ultimate talent of the person being executed.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Like what?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, there’s one where the Ultimate Baseball Star gets pelted with baseballs by a pitching machine. Until he’s, you know, not.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh. Okay. So it’s *that* kind of game. What about the dating sim part? Is that where you try to, like, charm the killer into confessing?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Not exactly. It’s more about building relationships with the other students in the "Daily Life" segments, which can give you skills for the "Class Trials." And during the trials, you’re literally shooting "Truth Bullets" at contradictions in people's arguments.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So it’s like a visual novel, but with bullets. And a homicidal teddy bear.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Pretty much! And the main character, Makoto Naegi, he’s just the Ultimate Lucky Student. He got in by lottery.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So he’s just… average? In a school full of ultimates? And he’s the one who has to solve all these murders?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah! He’s gotta use his brains, and his luck, to figure out who's doing what. It gets pretty wild. There’s a whole overarching mystery about *why* they’re trapped there and who’s really behind Monokuma.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Is it, like, a commentary on the nature of hope and despair?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah, there's a lot of that! The whole thing is steeped in themes of hope and despair.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, to recap: teenagers, trapped in a school, forced to kill each other by a sadistic teddy bear, with a heavy emphasis on class trials where you shoot truth bullets, all wrapped up in a story about hope and despair.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** That’s the gist of it!

**PRODUCER GUY:** I like it. It’s got a very unique… vibe. I think this could really resonate with people.
