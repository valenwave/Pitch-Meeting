**PRODUCER GUY:** So, you got a video game for me?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes sir, I do! It's the sequel to that awesome cyberpunk game, *Deus Ex: Human Revolution*. You know, the one where the guy has sword-arms and sunglasses built into his face.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, the "I never asked for this" guy! I remember him. He was very mopey about having super cool robot arms. So what's this one called?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** This one is called *Deus Ex: Mankind Divided*.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Sounds like a happy, uplifting story.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It's super cheerful, sir. So it takes place two years after the last game, where this thing called the "Aug Incident" happened. All the people with mechanical augmentations went crazy and started attacking everyone.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh yeah, that would probably cause some social tension.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** A little bit. So now, all augmented people, or "augs," are treated like outcasts. They're forced to live in ghettos and have separate train cars and everything. It's a very subtle metaphor for prejudice.

**PRODUCER GUY:** As subtle as a guy with a rocket launcher for an arm. Got it. So what's our hero Adam Jensen up to?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, he's back, and now he works for an Interpol anti-terrorist team called Task Force 29. But secretly, he's also working for a group of hacktivists called the Juggernaut Collective to expose a global conspiracy.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A double agent! That's cool.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Super cool. So the game opens with him in Prague, his new home base. He's on his way to meet a contact when a huge bomb goes off in the train station and knocks him out.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh no! Is he okay?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He's mostly fine, but the blast messes up his augmentations. He has to go see his tech guy to get them rebooted.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So he's all depowered and vulnerable at the start of the story.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, not exactly. It turns out the bomb blast somehow unlocked a bunch of secret, experimental augmentations he never knew he had.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wait, getting blown up gave him a software update?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It sure did! But there's a catch. His body can't handle all the new powers at once, so he has to permanently disable some of his old favorite abilities to use the new ones. It's a really tough choice for the player.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wow, that sounds like a difficult decision to make. It's going to be tough to part with those abilities.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Actually, it's going to be super easy, barely an inconvenience.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, really?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah, his tech guy just gives him a side quest, and after he completes it, he can turn on all the powers at once with no consequences.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So the tough, game-defining choice is completely undone an hour later.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** That's what I call character development, sir. Anyway, Jensen starts investigating the bombing and gets sent to this aug ghetto called Golem City. He finds out that a pro-aug terrorist group called ARC is being blamed.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Are they the real bad guys?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Nope! Jensen confronts their leader, a guy named Talos Rucker, who claims ARC is being framed. But right after he says that, he dies mysteriously from some kind of remote killswitch.

**PRODUCER GUY:** How convenient for the plot.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Very convenient! So Jensen realizes there's a conspiracy within his own organization, Task Force 29. The real villain is a secret group trying to pass a UN law that would ship all augmented people to a remote prison city.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A secret conspiracy run by shadowy figures? In a cyberpunk story? Groundbreaking.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** I know, right? So it all culminates in London during a big summit for a powerful CEO. The main henchman, a huge augmented Russian guy named Marchenko, plans to blow up the building and poison all the pro-aug leaders in attendance.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh no! So Jensen has to make another tough choice: save the people from the bomb, or stop Marchenko from releasing the poison.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** That's the idea! He can't possibly be in two places at once!

**PRODUCER GUY:** So it's an impossible situation.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, if he has the leg and dash augmentations, he can actually run really fast and do both pretty easily.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Of course he can.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So he confronts Marchenko for the final boss fight! It's this super epic showdown! Or, if he found a specific item earlier in the level, he can just use a killswitch to defeat him instantly.

**PRODUCER GUY:** An instant-win button for the climax of the story. Fantastic.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So Jensen saves the day, but the real masterminds behind the whole plot get away completely, pulling the strings from the shadows.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So... the story just stops?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah! It ends on a huge cliffhanger to set up the next game!

**PRODUCER GUY:** And when is that next game coming out?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Uh... well... we're still working on that part.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So you made a game that's all setup and no conclusion.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It's about the journey, sir! Not the destination! Plus, we have a mid-credits scene that reveals even more people were secretly part of the conspiracy all along!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wow. A story about a divided world that ends on a massive, unresolved cliffhanger. I'm sure gamers will find that deeply satisfying and not at all frustrating.
