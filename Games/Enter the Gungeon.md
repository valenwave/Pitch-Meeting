**PRODUCER GUY:** So, you got a new video game for me?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes sir, I do! It's a dungeon crawler called *Enter the Gungeon*.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Gungeon? Is that a portmanteau of "gun" and "dungeon"?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It is!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh my god.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So the game is about a handful of misfits who travel to a distant planet to enter a magical fortress called the Gungeon.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Please stop saying Gungeon.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No can do, sir. So they're there to find a legendary treasure: a gun that can kill the past.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Kill the past? How do you shoot a concept? Does the bullet hit your brain and give you very specific amnesia?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Hey, shut up. So this Gungeon is full of enemies. They're called the Gundead.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Are they guns that came back to life?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Not exactly. They're sentient bullets and shotgun shells that carry little guns of their own.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wait, so you're a person with a gun, shooting bullets, at other bullets, who are also shooting bullets back at you?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly! It's what's known as a "bullet hell!"

**PRODUCER GUY:** Yeah, that sounds like a description of hell made of bullets, for sure.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** And the whole place is just lousy with gun puns. There are bosses like the Gatling Gull, the Ammoconda, and the Beholster.

**PRODUCER GUY:** It's like my dad's email forwards came to life and made a video game.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** And to fight all these enemies, the player can find over 200 different guns!

**PRODUCER GUY:** That's a lot of guns.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It is! There's a gun that's a beehive and shoots bees, a gun that looks like a lowercase 'r' and shoots the letters 'b' 'u' 'l' 'l' 'e' 't', there's a gun that's a mailbox and it shoots envelopes...

**PRODUCER GUY:** Weaponized correspondence is tight! But with all these enemies shooting bullets, and bosses filling the screen with projectiles, it sounds like you're going to be constantly getting hit.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Actually, it's going to be super easy, barely an inconvenience.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, really?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah, see, the player character can do a little dodge roll. For the half-second they're in the middle of the roll, they're completely invincible and bullets just pass right through them.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A magic invincibility somersault?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** That's the one! You can also flip over tables to use as cover.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So you survive a hail of gunfire by doing gymnastics and throwing furniture around. Makes sense.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So you fight your way through five floors of the Gungeon, getting stronger, and then you have to assemble the Bullet That Can Kill the Past.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Right, the conceptual firearm.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Then you shoot yourself in the head with it!

**PRODUCER GUY:** What?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, that transports you to a final boss fight against a physical manifestation of your character's greatest regret. For one character, you fight a corrupt space cop. For another, you fight a floating eyeball in a military helmet.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Of course you do. So you beat your past, and you win!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** You do! But if you die at any point before that, you get sent right back to the very beginning. You lose all your guns and items and have to start over from scratch.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So the game is incredibly difficult and punishes you severely for failure.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Immensely so!

**PRODUCER GUY:** A punishingly hard game, full of puns, where you have to shoot bullets at other bullets with a gun that shoots mail, all so you can commit metaphysical suicide to fight your own memories. This sounds incredibly niche. I'm not sure people will have the patience for it.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** I think they'll find it very rewarding, sir!

**PRODUCER GUY:** If you say so. I'm sure it'll be a little indie game that a few people enjoy and then it fades away.
