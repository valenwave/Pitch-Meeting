***PRODUCER GUY:*** So, what's the pitch?

---

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Okay, so it's a video game. A first-person shooter... but also a role-playing game. And a stealth game.

***PRODUCER GUY:*** Whoa, whoa, whoa. Pick one. We can't have a game that's all of those things. That sounds... complicated.

---

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, see, that's the thing! It's an "immersive sim." You're this super-augmented agent in a dystopian future, and you can approach every situation how you want. You want to go guns blazing? Go for it! You want to sneak through vents and hack everything? You can! You want to just talk your way out of trouble? You can even do that!

***PRODUCER GUY:*** So, it's like a choose-your-own-adventure book, but with more shooting?

---

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly! And the story is about, like, all the conspiracy theories. The Illuminati, Majestic 12, secret societies running the world, a global plague, the whole nine yards!

***PRODUCER GUY:*** The Illuminati? Really? Isn't that a little... on the nose?

---

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, it's timely! People love that stuff. And you play as this guy, JC Denton, who's got these super cool nanotech augmentations. He's like, the next generation of super-soldiers, and he starts working for this anti-terrorist group called UNATCO. But then he finds out they're actually evil! And his brother, Paul, is involved!

***PRODUCER GUY:*** So, the good guys are bad guys? That's a twist! I like twists. But nanotech? Can we just give him, like, a really big gun? People understand big guns.

---

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** The nanotech lets him do all sorts of cool stuff, like regenerating health, jumping super high, becoming invisible...

***PRODUCER GUY:*** Invisible? That sounds like it would make the stealth part redundant.

---

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It's about *choice*, Producer Guy! And then, there's this plague, the Gray Death, and the only cure, Ambrosia, is being withheld by the bad guys to control the population!

***PRODUCER GUY:*** A plague, huh? And the rich people get the cure, but the poor people don't? That's... surprisingly relevant. But are we sure about the name "Gray Death"? Sounds a little too much like a bad band name.

---

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** And you're traveling all over the world! New York, Hong Kong, Paris, Area 51!

***PRODUCER GUY:*** Area 51! Okay, now you're talking. That's a good place for, you know, aliens. Are there aliens?

---

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Not exactly. More like, super-advanced AIs and augmented super-soldiers. And the World Trade Center towers aren't there in New York. It's a subtle touch to show how grim the future is.

***PRODUCER GUY:*** Wait, the World Trade Center? You just... removed them? Is that allowed?

---

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It's fiction! And it was a technical limitation back then, but we just said terrorists. It adds to the gritty, conspiracy vibe. The game actually adapts to your choices. If you kill everyone, people react differently. If you try to be non-lethal, the story shifts. There are multiple endings!

***PRODUCER GUY:*** Multiple endings, you say? So, people have to play it more than once? That's good for sales! But the voice acting for some of the minor characters... is it good?

---

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It's... distinctive. Let's call it "cult classic" voice acting.

***PRODUCER GUY:*** Hmm. Well, this "immersive sim" thing, sounds like it has potential. People like to feel powerful, and they like to make choices. This could be big. Really big.

---

**PRODUCER GUY:** This game is going to redefine a genre, mark my words!
