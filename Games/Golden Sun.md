**PRODUCER GUY:** So, you got a new video game for me?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes sir, I do! It’s a fantasy role-playing game for a handheld console. We're calling it *Golden Sun*.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Golden Sun, huh? Sounds bright and cheerful. I like it.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So the game opens on a dark and stormy night. A giant boulder is rolling towards a fantasy village called Vale, and our hero, a young boy named Isaac, is trying to escape.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Sounds pretty intense for a cheerful game.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It is! And tragedy strikes. Isaac's father, along with his friend Felix's parents, are seemingly crushed by the boulder while trying to save everyone. Felix is also washed away by the river and presumed dead.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Whoa, whoa, whoa... wow. We're killing off the main character's family and his best friend in the first ten minutes? That's pretty dark.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly! It sets up the emotional stakes. So then we jump forward three years. Isaac, who is now a silent protagonist...

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, a silent protagonist. So he just stares blankly while other people talk at him?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He can nod or shake his head! Anyway, he, his friend Garet, and his other friend Jenna decide to explore a forbidden shrine called Sol Sanctum with their teacher.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Why would they do that?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Because they're curious teenagers! So they get deep inside and find these four magical jewels called the Elemental Stars. But then, the villains from the prologue show up! And who is with them? Felix!

**PRODUCER GUY:** The kid who was presumed dead?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** The very same! He's alive and working with the bad guys, Saturos and Menardi. They force Isaac to retrieve three of the four Elemental Stars for them, kidnap Jenna, and then cause the volcano the shrine is in to erupt.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Man, these kids have the worst luck with geology.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So as the volcano is erupting, a mysterious floating rock-head thing calling itself the Wise One appears and tasks Isaac and Garet with a sacred quest: get the stars back and prevent the villains from lighting four Elemental Lighthouses across the world.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Why? What happens if they light the lighthouses?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It will unleash the dangerous and destructive power of Alchemy upon the world!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, so it's a world-ending catastrophe. Got it.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So Isaac and Garet set off. Isaac, of course, says nothing about this grave responsibility he's just been given.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Of course not. So it's just the two of them against this powerful group that already beat them once? That's going to be tough.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Actually, it's going to be super easy, barely an inconvenience.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, really?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah, see, pretty quickly they run into another kid named Ivan who is trying to get a stolen magic rod back. He can read minds.

**PRODUCER GUY:** He can read minds? Does that come in handy?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Constantly! It’s how you get clues from NPCs who won’t talk. So he reads Isaac's mind, understands the gravity of the silent quest, and just decides to join them. Then they travel to a wintery town where they meet a girl named Mia, who is the guardian of the Mercury Lighthouse. The villains show up, light the lighthouse anyway, and she just decides to join the party too.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So people just join this silent kid's quest on a whim?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It seems so! And they all have this power called Psynergy, which is basically magic. They can move pillars, grow vines, and freeze puddles to solve all the puzzles.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Freezing puddles is tight! So what are the villains' motivations here? Are they just evil?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, you see, they believe that if they *don't* unleash the destructive power of Alchemy, the world will slowly wither and die.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wait, so they're trying to save the world by potentially destroying it?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It's a nuanced philosophical position!

**PRODUCER GUY:** It sounds like they're just эко-terrorists with confusing logic.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So the party chases Saturos and Menardi across continents, from one lighthouse to the next. They fail to stop them from lighting the Venus Lighthouse, but at the top, they have a big final showdown.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Finally! So they beat the bad guys, get Jenna back, and save the day!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** They beat Saturos and Menardi, yes. But just as they do, the lighthouse is activated, a giant beam shoots into the sky, and Sheba, another one of their captives, falls off the lighthouse. Felix jumps after her, and they both vanish. Jenna is still missing with the rest of the bad guys.

**PRODUCER GUY:** What? So they didn't accomplish anything? They failed to stop two lighthouses from being lit and didn't rescue their friend?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Correct. The game just ends.

**PRODUCER GUY:** It just ends?! That's not an ending!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It is if you want people to buy the sequel!

**PRODUCER GUY:** A role-playing game about silent teenagers chasing villains who think they're the good guys, only for the story to abruptly stop halfway through. I don't know... it sounds a bit risky.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Trust me, people will be desperate to know what happens next.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Well, it's weird, the motivation is confusing, and the hero doesn't talk. But those little creature things, the Djinn, are kind of cute. People love collecting cute things. This will probably do okay.
