**PRODUCER GUY:** So, you've got another horror game idea for me, huh?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** That's right! It's called Dollmare.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Dollmare. Dolls. And a mare. Like a nightmare. I get it. What's the pitch?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Okay, so, you're a person who's really down on their luck. Rent's due, you're desperate for cash, so you take this job at a doll factory.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A doll factory. Right. Are there, like, creepy dolls? Because that's a thing, you know. Creepy dolls.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Oh, you bet there are! Your job is to sort them. Good dolls go on one conveyor belt, bad ones get tossed. But as you're sorting, you start noticing things. Missing limbs, weird voices... some of them even seem alive.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Alive? So, are they, like, chasing you around? Is it a jumpscare-a-minute kind of deal? Because those are popular.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, not really. The developers were actually too scared to play other horror games, so they made this one different. It's more psychological. It's about the atmosphere. You feel watched, things happen when you're not looking. It's unsettling.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Unsettling. So, you're just... sorting dolls and feeling unsettled? That sounds like my Monday morning.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Not just sorting! You also find notes from the previous employee, "K," who clearly knows something. And as the nights go on, you get more tasks. Repairing dolls, scanning them for internal anomalies, even blacklighting them for strange marks.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Blacklighting dolls? What, are we checking for doll drugs? This just got a whole lot more exciting!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** And sometimes, you'll get faxes for specific dolls that need to be packaged for delivery.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Faxes. In a horror game. That's a bold choice. Does the fax machine also try to eat you? Because that would be pretty scary.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, no fax monster. But you're the only worker there, besides the mysterious "Director" who's always watching. And you can explore the factory! Uncover its secrets. There are multiple endings, too.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Multiple endings. So, people will play it more than once. That's good for the old replayability metric. Are the scares randomized? Like, every playthrough is different?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly! Many events aren't scripted, so what you encounter changes. No two players will have the exact same experience.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Okay, okay, I'm starting to get it. A horror game where you sort dolls, slowly uncover a mystery, and it's mostly about the creepy atmosphere and randomized scares rather than just screaming at you. And no chasing monsters. That's... different. It could work. People are always looking for something new in horror.

**PRODUCER GUY:** This game, Dollmare, it's got a unique hook. I think it could find its audience.
