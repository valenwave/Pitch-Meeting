**PRODUCER GUY:** So, you've got this new game idea for me? Another fantasy RPG?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Oh, you betcha! It's called... *The Elder Scrolls!*

**PRODUCER GUY:** The Elder Scrolls? What are those, like... scrolls that are really old? Is it about librarians? 'Cause I gotta tell ya, the "Librarian Simulator" demographic is pretty niche.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, no, it's not about librarians! It's about this massive world, Tamriel, with all these different races â€“ elves, humans, cat people, lizard people...

**PRODUCER GUY:** Cat people? So, like, Furries: The Game? Is it going to be rated M for *Meow*?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No! They're Khajiit! And they're just one of many! And the first game, *Arena*, it started as a gladiator fighting game, but then we decided, "Hey, what if you could just... explore the entire continent?"

**PRODUCER GUY:** The entire continent? So you're telling me you built an entire world, but you couldn't think of a better title than *Arena*? Was "Big Place Where Stuff Happens" taken?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, it evolved! And then for the second one, *Daggerfall*, we made the map even bigger! Like, 160,000 square kilometers!

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, you just made it bigger? Is that the whole pitch? "It's the same, but *more*"? Are you selling jumbo shrimp here?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, it's got more! You can own houses, join guilds, become a vampire or a werewolf! And there are multiple endings!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Multiple endings? So, I play the whole game, and then it's like, "Surprise! You actually failed!" What if I want a guaranteed happy ending? Do I get a participation trophy?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Then came *Morrowind*! We really honed in on the lore there. You're this prophesied hero, the Nerevarine, sent to stop a blight in a volcanic island.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A blight? So, like, a cough? Is the villain a giant lung?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No! And then *Oblivion*! Gates to a demonic realm are opening all over the place! And the emperor gets assassinated right at the start!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, so it's a political thriller? Is it *House of Cards* with swords? Are there backstabbing politicians who are also literal demons?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** And then, the big one, *Skyrim*! Dragons are back! And you're the Dragonborn, who can shout at them and steal their souls!

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, basically, it's a game about a very angry person with a sore throat. And they're going to fight dragons. Isn't that a bit... on the nose? "Dragonborn fights dragons"? What's next, "Fishman fights fish"?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It's epic! You learn shouts, you explore ancient Nordic ruins, you fight a civil war!

**PRODUCER GUY:** A civil war? So, it's like *Gettysburg*, but with dragons instead of cannons? Do I get to ride a dragon into battle? Because if not, I'm already bored.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** And the music! And the open world! People love to just wander around, explore, find random caves...

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, it's a walking simulator with occasional yelling? I'm sensing a theme here. And how many times are you going to re-release *Skyrim*? Are we going to have *Skyrim: The Board Game*, *Skyrim: The Musical*, *Skyrim: On Ice*?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It just keeps selling! People love it! They keep buying it on every new console, every new piece of technology! It's got legs!

**PRODUCER GUY:** You know what, you're right. People love open worlds. They love fantasy. And they *really* love shouting at things. This is going to be huge. Just make sure the dragons look cool. And maybe add a fishing mechanic. People love fishing.
