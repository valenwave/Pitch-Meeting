**PRODUCER GUY:** So, you got a new video game for me?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes sir, I do! It’s a JRPG about time travel. I call it *Chrono Trigger*.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Chrono Trigger. Sounds like something you’d name a watch you bought from a guy in an alley.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It’s very prestigious, sir. So the game starts with our hero, Crono, who is woken up by his mom to go to the Millennial Fair.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A Millennial Fair? So it’s full of avocado toast and people complaining about student loans?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, a fair celebrating the year 1000. And Crono is a silent protagonist.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, a silent protagonist. So we save a lot of money on voice acting. I love it.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly! So at the fair, he bumps into this girl named Marle, and they go check out his friend Lucca’s new invention: a teleporter!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Let me guess, something goes horribly wrong with the teleporter.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Something goes horribly wrong with the teleporter. Marle’s special necklace reacts with the machine and she gets sucked into a time vortex!

**PRODUCER GUY:** A time vortex! That sounds dangerous.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So Crono bravely decides to jump in after her. He lands in the year 600 A.D., where he finds out Marle has been mistaken for her ancestor, Queen Leene, who was supposed to be kidnapped. But since Marle is there, nobody goes looking for the real queen, which creates a paradox that will erase Marle from existence.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wow, so he’s only been time traveling for five minutes and he’s already broken the entire timeline and is about to erase his new friend. It's going to be tough to fix that.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Actually, it’s going to be super easy, barely an inconvenience.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, really?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah, he just teams up with a talking knight who is also a frog.

**PRODUCER GUY:** He’s a what now?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** His name is Frog, and he helps Crono rescue the real queen, which fixes the paradox and Marle comes back.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A talking frog knight saves the day. Got it. Totally normal.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So they go back to their own time, but when they return, Crono gets put on trial for kidnapping the princess.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wait, Marle is a princess?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** She is! But don’t worry, Lucca breaks him out of jail and they escape, but they get cornered and jump into another time portal to escape. This time they go to the year 2300 A.D.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Okay, so what’s the future like? Flying cars? Robot butlers?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It’s a post-apocalyptic wasteland where everyone is starving and hiding from killer robots.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh. So not great, then.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Not great at all. And they find a recording of the day the world was destroyed in 1999 by a giant alien parasite that erupted from the center of the planet. Its name is Lavos.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Lavos. Sounds scary.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He is! So now the whole point of the game is to travel through all of time to stop Lavos from ever destroying the world. Along the way they’ll team up with Robo, a friendly robot from the future; Ayla, a super strong cavewoman from 65,000,000 B.C.; and Magus, the dark wizard who they thought was the bad guy but was actually just trying to stop Lavos himself.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So the team is a silent teenager, a princess, a nerdy inventor, a cursed frog man, a robot, a cavewoman, and the goth wizard who was their enemy like an hour ago.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It’s a well-rounded party, sir. So they travel all over time, from prehistoric jungles to a magical floating kingdom in 12,000 B.C. that gets its power from Lavos.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A floating kingdom powered by a world-ending space hedgehog. What could possibly go wrong?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Everything! Lavos awakens and Crono sacrifices himself to save everyone else from being killed.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wow wow wow… wow. You kill the main character? The guy the game is named after?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** We do! He gets completely vaporized.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Well, I guess it’s up to the rest of the gang to save the day, then. It's going to be tough to win without the main hero.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Actually, it’s going to be super easy, barely an inconvenience.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, really?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah, see, they just have to find this egg-shaped time machine called the Chrono Trigger. Then they go to the Millennial Fair at the beginning of the game and win a clone doll of Crono from a carnival game. Then they climb a frozen mountain, go to the exact moment of Crono’s death, and swap him out with the doll right before he gets vaporized.

**PRODUCER GUY:** They replace him with a carnival prize? That’s the plan?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It works perfectly. So with Crono back in the party, they fight Lavos and save the future. And there are a bunch of different endings depending on when you beat the game!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Multiple endings are tight.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** They are! So, what do you think?

**PRODUCER GUY:** A time-traveling epic with a silent hero who dies and is replaced by a doll, a party that includes a frog and a cavewoman, and a plot so complex you need a flowchart to follow it... It sounds way too ambitious and weird. I don't think anyone's going to play this.
