**PRODUCER GUY:** So, what's the pitch?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Okay, so it's a simulator game.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, good, good. Those are popular. People love to simulate things. What are we simulating? Truck driving? Farming? Space exploration?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** We're simulating... lawn mowing.

**PRODUCER GUY:** ...Lawn mowing? As in, cutting grass? With a... with a lawn mower?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes! You get to experience the beauty and detail of mowing the Great British countryside!

**PRODUCER GUY:** The Great British countryside. So, instead of, like, a race car, I'm driving a... Toro?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly! We've got real-world licensed mowers from prestigious manufacturers like Toro, SCAG, and STIGA! You can feel the deep rumble of the engine!

**PRODUCER GUY:** The deep rumble of the engine as I go back and forth in straight lines. Sounds... exhilarating. What's the goal? Do I, like, win a race against other mowers? Is there a boss fight with a giant weed?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** You manage your own lawn care business! You take on contracts, pick up objects on the lawn, set your blade height, measure your engine load...

**PRODUCER GUY:** Hold on, pick up objects? Like, gnomes? Or just, like, rocks? Because if I run over a gnome, I'm gonna be pretty upset.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** You get bonus cash for picking up items! And sometimes you find lost valuables! It adds a layer of... discovery! Then you have to strategically mow the lawn, make sure you don't damage flowers or the ground, because you'll get fined!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Fined for hitting a flower. So it's a game about meticulous perfection? Is there a "undo last cut" button? Because I feel like I'm going to miss a spot and then have to go back. And that's just like real life, only I'm sitting down.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** We also have a career mode where you build your business from the ground up! You can hire employees, upgrade your headquarters, purchase advertising...

**PRODUCER GUY:** So it's *Lawn Mowing Business Simulator*? Because that's a different game. That's, like, spreadsheets and employee reviews. I thought I was just getting to cut grass.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, it's all part of the experience! You unlock new mowers, different attachments like stripe rollers, mulching kits... You can even mow vast castle grounds!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Castle grounds, eh? So I can pretend I'm a medieval groundskeeper, just with a modern, high-powered, low-excitement vehicle. Does it have a multi-player mode where we can race to see who can stripe a lawn faster?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Not exactly a race, but there's a challenge mode where you have limited fuel or time!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Limited fuel? So I have to plan my cuts like some kind of lawn-mowing tactical genius? This is getting intense! Will there be an e-sports league for virtual lawn mowing? Because I'm in if there's a prize. Maybe a real lawn mower.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** You'd be surprised how relaxing and satisfying it can be. It's a zen experience. Like ASMR, but with engine sounds.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, you're telling me people will pay money to meticulously cut virtual grass for hours on end, without the benefit of fresh air or actual exercise?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It's surprisingly addictive! And it fills a niche!

**PRODUCER GUY:** You know what? It just might work. People like simple, repetitive tasks that give a sense of accomplishment. And if it's set in the Great British countryside, that's already got a certain charm. I think this could be a sleeper hit.
