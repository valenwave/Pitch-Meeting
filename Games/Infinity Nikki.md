**PRODUCER GUY:** So, you got a new video game for me?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes sir, I do! It's a massive, open-world adventure game set in a sprawling fantasy land called Miraland.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, I like it! Big swords, epic combat, maybe some dragons?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Even better. It's a dress-up game.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A... what now?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It's an open-world dress-up adventure game! Our hero, Nikki, and her talking cat friend, Momo, are transported to Miraland to save it from a terrible fate.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A talking cat sidekick. Very innovative. So how does Nikki save the world? With the power of friendship?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** With the power of fashion! See, different outfits give her different magical abilities.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So she fights evil with... a stylish accessory?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly! For example, she gets a Gliding Outfit that lets her float across big gaps.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Okay, a magic dress that lets her fly. I can see that. Seems pretty standard for a video game.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** But then she gets a Purification Outfit!

**PRODUCER GUY:** And what does that do? Shoot lasers?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, it lets her cleanse corrupted little monsters by waving her magical clothes at them, which makes them all better.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wow wow wow... wow. So there's no combat?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** There is, but it's super simple. The main thing is the outfits! Like the Fishing Outfit!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Does that let her breathe underwater?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, it makes her shrink down to a super tiny size so she can float on a big leaf and fish.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Why does she need to be tiny to fish?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So it's cuter, sir. Anyway, she'll come across these big, impassable obstacles, like a huge cliff with no way to climb it.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Yikes. It's going to be tough to get past that.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Actually, it's going to be super easy, barely an inconvenience.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, really?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah, she'll just put on her Gliding Outfit and create a magical wind current out of nowhere to lift her right to the top.

**PRODUCER GUY:** She makes her own wind? With a dress?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** She sure does! And her cat companion Momo helps out too.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Right, the talking cat. What's his deal?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He offers witty commentary, loves grilled fish, and can also turn into a camera.

**PRODUCER GUY:** He's a cat-camera.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** A Cat-mera, yes. So Nikki runs around this huge world, solving puzzles, taking pictures with her cat, and collecting materials to craft hundreds of different clothing items to solve all of her problems.

**PRODUCER GUY:** An open-world game where all problems can be solved by putting on a new pair of pants. I'm not sure people are going to go for this. It sounds a little... different.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** But the outfits are really pretty!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Well, I suppose a game that combines the deep exploration of an RPG with the strategic depth of playing dress-up can't possibly fail. It's a foolproof plan.
