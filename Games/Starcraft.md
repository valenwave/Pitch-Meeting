**PRODUCER GUY:** So, you got a new video game for me?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes sir, I do! It's a big science fiction real-time strategy game called *Starcraft*.

**PRODUCER GUY:** *Starcraft*, huh? Sounds like it's about crafting stars.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Not quite, sir. It’s about three distinct alien races all fighting each other for control of the galaxy.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Three races, you say? Let me guess: there are the good guy humans, the evil monster aliens, and then some really wise, ancient aliens.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** You pretty much nailed it, sir. We have the Terrans, who are basically human outcasts with a space-western vibe. Lots of marines and cowboys.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Space cowboys are tight.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Then you have the Zerg, which are this insect-like hive mind that just wants to consume and assimilate all life in the universe.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, the evil monster aliens. Got it.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** And finally, the Protoss. They are a super-advanced race of psionic warriors with cool energy blades and a very stoic, honorable culture.

**PRODUCER GUY:** The wise, ancient aliens. Knew it. So what’s the plot?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** The game kicks off with the Terrans colonizing planets in a far-off section of the galaxy called the Koprulu Sector. Everything is going fine for them.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Sounds a little boring.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, it gets exciting when the Zerg suddenly appear and start infesting all their worlds!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh no! So the Terran space cowboys have to fight off the bug monsters?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly! As the player, you command the Terran forces, building bases, training up an army of marines, siege tanks, and spaceships, and then you go and try to wipe out the Zerg.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Build, train, destroy. A classic.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** But then the Protoss show up, and they are not happy at all.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Why not? The Zerg bothering them, too?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes, but the Protoss are so against the Zerg that their solution is to just set entire Terran planets on fire from orbit to stop the infestation from spreading.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wow, that seems a bit extreme for the wise, ancient aliens.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** They're very committed. So now the poor Terrans are stuck fighting a war against both the Zerg and the Protoss!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Yikes. It's going to be tough to fight off two powerful alien races at the same time.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Actually, it’s super easy, barely an inconvenience.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, really?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah, you just have to get really good at managing your economy and building a massive army really, really fast. We call that "macro." Then you just have to have faster reflexes and click on your units better than your opponent. That's "micro."

**PRODUCER GUY:** Macro and micro. Sounds simple enough for a video game.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It is! And the story is full of memorable characters. There's this heroic Terran marshal, Jim Raynor, and a powerful psychic operative named Sarah Kerrigan.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A psychic lady? I bet she and the hero fall in love.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** They sure do! But then the main Terran leader, a real bad guy named Arcturus Mengsk, betrays them and leaves Kerrigan to die on a Zerg-infested planet.

**PRODUCER GUY:** What a jerk! So she’s gone?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Oh, it’s much worse than that. The Zerg capture her and assimilate her into their swarm. She transforms into the Queen of Blades, a powerful and evil Zerg-human hybrid!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wow wow wow... wow. So the hero’s girlfriend becomes the main villain?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** That's the twist! Now Raynor wants revenge on Mengsk for the betrayal, but he also wants to save Kerrigan, who is now the queen of the evil bug monsters. It’s very dramatic.

**PRODUCER GUY:** That is dramatic. So how does it all wrap up?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, after you play through all three campaigns, there’s a massive final battle. The main Protoss hero, Tassadar, sacrifices himself by flying his giant flagship carrier right into the Zerg's supreme leader, the Overmind.

**PRODUCER GUY:** He crashes his spaceship into a giant floating brain?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He sure does! It causes a huge psychic explosion and kills the Overmind.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Amazing! So the Zerg are defeated and the galaxy is saved?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Not quite. The Zerg swarm is thrown into chaos, but the now-evil Kerrigan is still out there, and she starts taking control of the remaining Zerg for herself. The war is definitely not over.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Ah, leaving room for a sequel. Smart. So, a deep sci-fi story with three unique factions, strategic base-building, and intense combat that requires lightning-fast reflexes. I have a strange feeling this will be unusually popular in South Korea.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** I think people are going to love it, sir.

**PRODUCER GUY:** This is going to be massive. I bet people will still be playing this competitively in twenty years.
