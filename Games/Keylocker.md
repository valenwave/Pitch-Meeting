**PRODUCER GUY:** So, you got a new video game for me?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes, sir, I do! It's a cyberpunk JRPG about a silent world where music is outlawed. You play as a singer and songwriter named B0B0.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A silent world? So, no dialogue?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, it's just that music is illegal. The game has a full script and everything.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh. So why is music illegal?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, because music can create electricity, and the tyrannical rulers, the Saturnian Satellites, want to control all the electricity. So, our hero B0B0 uses her music to fight them and free the people.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, she's a musician who fights with her music.  I mean, that sounds cool! It's a JRPG, so is it turn-based combat?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It is, but with a twist! You have to time your button presses to the beat to make your attacks stronger and to parry enemy attacks. It's like a rhythm game mixed with a JRPG.

**PRODUCER GUY:** What about the enemies? Are they all police officers and government agents?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Most of them, yeah. The church-police will come after you if you disrespect the Law of Silence.

**PRODUCER GUY:** The church-police? Oh, that's a good one. What happens if you get caught?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** You go to jail, of course! Which is what happens to B0B0 right at the beginning. But don't worry, she escapes.

**PRODUCER GUY:** She breaks out of jail just to keep making music? What a hero! But what's the goal here? What's the main quest?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** She wants to find a robot drummer to join her illegal band so they can "disconcert" the authorities and overthrow the system.

**PRODUCER GUY:** She's going to start a revolution to free the people with a rock band?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** That's the idea, sir!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Okay, okay, that's not bad. So you play through the story, you play gigs with your band, you fight the authorities... And then what happens?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** You have a choice! You can choose to be a ruthless rebel, a master hacker, or whatever, and that affects the story. There are multiple endings.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Multiple endings are tight. It sounds a little strange. A rhythm JRPG about an illegal punk band in a cyberpunk world. I'm not sure people are going to get it.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Oh, they will, sir. I think it's got a really dedicated, niche audience waiting for it.

**PRODUCER GUY:** I suppose so. Well, it's probably just going to be one of those weird indie games that gets a cult following.

**PC Gamer: "Keylocker is an ambitious and enjoyable action RPG."**
