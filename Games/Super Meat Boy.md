**PRODUCER GUY:** So, you have a new video game for me?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes sir, I do! It's an indie platformer called *Super Meat Boy*.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Super Meat Boy? What's his deal?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He's a boy, but he's made of meat. And he doesn't have any skin.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, lovely. So he's just a walking pile of bloody muscle tissue?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly! And he's got a girlfriend named Bandage Girl.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Of course he does. A skinless meat-cube and his ambulatory first-aid kit girlfriend. This is a very normal video game.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It is! But then the evil Dr. Fetus kidnaps Bandage Girl!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Dr. Fetus?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah, he's a fetus in a jar who pilots a mech suit. He hates Meat Boy for some reason.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So a fetus in a jar hates a boy made of meat. I feel like there's a metaphor here I'm not smart enough to understand.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So Meat Boy has to jump and run through over 300 levels to save her! And these levels are incredibly difficult.

**PRODUCER GUY:** How difficult are we talking?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, everything kills you in one hit. There are buzzsaws everywhere. Also spikes, lava, salt piles, and homing missiles.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wait, go back. Salt piles? Why is salt a deadly obstacle?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, he's made of meat, sir. Salt would be very dehydrating.

**PRODUCER GUY:** That makes a disgusting amount of sense. So players are just going to be dying constantly. Sounds super frustrating.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Oh, they will die. A lot. But that's the fun! Every time he runs, he leaves a trail of blood on the ground and walls. So by the end of the level, the whole place is just painted red.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So it’s a game about failing over and over while leaving a gruesome bloodstain on everything you touch. This sounds like a hard sell.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** But see, when you die, you respawn instantly at the beginning of the level. No lives, no game over screen. You just go again. And again. And again.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wow. So facing an impossible wall of buzzsaws and death lasers is going to be tough to overcome.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Actually, it’s going to be super easy, barely an inconvenience.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, really?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah, the controls are super tight and responsive, and the respawns are so fast that dying just becomes part of the learning process. You'll die hundreds of times on a single level, but it feels fair.

**PRODUCER GUY:** It sounds fair-strating.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** And the best part is, after you finally beat a level, the game shows you a replay of all your attempts at once! So you see hundreds of Meat Boys running and dying simultaneously until the one successful run makes it to the end.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A simultaneous replay of all your painful failures. That's a feature.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It is! So he fights his way through a forest, a hospital, a salt factory, and even literal Hell to confront Dr. Fetus and save Bandage Girl!

**PRODUCER GUY:** An indie game with retro graphics that's designed to be punishingly difficult and make the player feel bad at video games. I’m not sure who this is for.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** I think people will appreciate the challenge, sir!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Well, if you say so. I'm sure it will be a small, niche title that a few hardcore fans enjoy.
