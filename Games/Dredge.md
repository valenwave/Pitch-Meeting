**PRODUCER GUY:** So, you got a new video game for me?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes sir, I do! It’s a nice, cozy little fishing game called *Dredge*.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, a cozy fishing game! I love that. Very relaxing. Just you, the open water, a fishing rod...

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly! So you play as a Fisherman who crashes his boat and wakes up in the mysterious coastal town of Greater Marrow. The mayor gives you a new boat and asks you to help the town by catching fish to pay off your debt.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A story about crippling debt. Super relaxing.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It is! And you sail around, catch different kinds of fish, sell them, and upgrade your boat. There's even a little inventory management system that's kind of like *Tetris*.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So it's a fishing *Tetris* game. I like it.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah! But only during the day.

**PRODUCER GUY:** What happens at night?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Oh, at night everything tries to kill you.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wow wow wow... wow.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah, see, a thick, spooky fog rolls in, phantom boats start ramming you, giant sea monsters attack, and the fish you catch are these horrible, mutated monstrosities with extra eyes and teeth.

**PRODUCER GUY:** That doesn't sound very cozy at all.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** And if you stay out too long, you start to panic and hallucinate! Rocks will just pop up out of nowhere to smash your boat!

**PRODUCER GUY:** So the moral of the story is to have a healthy sleep schedule.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Precisely. Anyway, you meet this mysterious Collector who lives all by himself on a creepy island, and he wants you to dredge up five old relics from shipwrecks around the archipelago.

**PRODUCER GUY:** This Collector sounds like a perfectly normal and trustworthy guy.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He is! And to get these relics, you have to go to different island areas, each with their own unique giant monster trying to kill you.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Of course.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So in one area, Gale Cliffs, there’s this huge, territorial sea serpent that will just destroy your boat if you get too close to the relic.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Yikes. It's going to be tough to get past a giant sea serpent.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Actually, it's super easy, barely an inconvenience.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, really?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah, you just find some explosives and blow up a big rock archway, which collapses on the serpent and traps it.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Environmental problem solving is tight!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Then in another area, Stellar Basin, there's a giant kraken thing hiding in the middle of the ocean that will grab your boat with its tentacles.

**PRODUCER GUY:** How do you blow that one up?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** You don't! You just find some old research equipment and turn on some big lights, which scares it away for a little while so you can grab the relic. It’s a very shy kraken.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Awww, poor little multi-tentacled abomination.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So you gather all the relics, and along the way you learn that the Collector is trying to perform a ritual with a cursed crimson book to bring his dead wife back to life. Turns out that's what's causing all the fog and the monsters and the general cosmic horror.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh! So you have to stop him and save the day!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, you can help him if you want. He performs the ritual and his wife comes back as a giant Cthulhu-esque goddess who then promptly destroys the town.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Okay, so that’s the bad ending. What’s the good ending?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** The good ending is you talk to the Lighthouse Keeper, she tells you the truth, and you decide to take the cursed book and throw it back into the sea where it came from.

**PRODUCER GUY:** And that breaks the curse?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It sure does! The fog lifts, the monsters disappear, everything is peaceful again!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Amazing! And our hero sails off into the sunset?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Nope, throwing the book in the ocean summons a massive tidal wave that completely obliterates your boat and kills you instantly.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wait, what? The main character DIES in the good ending?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He does! But he saved everyone, so it's fine. It's a very happy ending where you die.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A cosmic horror fishing game where the best possible outcome is your own death. I'm not sure people are going to go for that.
