**PRODUCER GUY:** So you have a new idea for a game?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes, sir, I do! It’s called **Dredge**.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Okay, **Dredge**. What’s it about?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It’s a fishing game!

**PRODUCER GUY:** A fishing game. So like, **Animal Crossing** fishing? Or like, realistic fishing?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Uh, no, it’s more like… cosmic horror fishing.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Cosmic horror fishing? So like, Lovecraft, but with a fishing rod?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly! You’re a fisherman who washes up on this remote archipelago, and you have to fish during the day to upgrade your boat, but at night, things get… weird.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Weird how? Do the fish start talking?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, not exactly, but you start seeing things, like phantom boats in the fog, or strange creatures in the water. Your panic meter goes up, and the more panicked you are, the worse things get.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So you're saying I'm trying to catch fish while also trying not to lose my mind?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Precisely! And there are these ancient relics you're trying to recover for a mysterious figure, and it all ties into this larger narrative about a terrifying past.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So it's a fishing game, but it’s also a psychological thriller? And it’s got a **Cthulhu** vibe?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** You got it! And there are these different islands, each with its own unique fish and its own unique set of… dangers. Like, one area has these giant, glowing jellyfish, and another has these monstrous anglerfish that try to eat you.

**PRODUCER GUY:** And I'm just fishing through all this?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, you're also upgrading your boat, getting new equipment, selling your catch… and trying not to go insane. It's very immersive.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, to recap: It's a fishing game where I'm constantly terrified, trying to avoid Eldritch horrors, and also trying to pay off my boat. Sounds… unique.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It’s a fresh take on the genre!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Alright, I'm sold. I think this could be a sleeper hit.
