**PRODUCER GUY:** So, you got a video game for me?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes sir, I do! It's a hardcore military strategy game called *Advance Wars*.

**PRODUCER GUY:** *Advance Wars*! Sounds intense. I'm picturing gritty soldiers, realistic tactics, the horrors of war...

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It's got all of that! Well, it's got the tactics part. It's a turn-based strategy game where you command armies of infantry, tanks, artillery, battleships, and fighter jets. You have to manage resources, capture cities, and outmaneuver your opponent on a grid-based map.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Okay, very complex. So it's for the real strategy buffs.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly! Except all the soldiers are cute little cartoon characters who hop around, and the tanks look like they're made of Lego.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wow wow wow... wow.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah, and when your units fight, these two adorable little squads just line up and shoot at each other until one of them poofs out of existence.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So it's a cheerful, bright, and colorful game about brutal warfare.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** You get it, sir. So, you play as one of several Commanding Officers, or COs, for the Orange Star army. There's Andy, a kid who is a genius mechanic.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A child is leading an army?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He's very good with wrenches. Then there's Max, a big strong guy whose tanks hit extra hard, and Sami, a special forces expert whose foot soldiers are super powerful and can capture cities really fast.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So one little infantry guy can just walk up to an entire city and say "this is mine now"?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He sure can! It's a very big flag he plants.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Planting flags is tight.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So you're fighting the other nations, like Blue Moon, Green Earth, and Yellow Comet.

**PRODUCER GUY:** And they all have their own unique military hardware, I assume?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Oh no, they use the exact same tanks and planes as you, just painted a different color.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So it's one big international arms manufacturer making a killing off this war.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** We don't explore the economic implications, sir. Anyway, each CO has a special CO Power they can use when they've done enough fighting.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So let's say my army is completely wrecked. My tanks are smoking, my soldiers are down to their last guy, and a giant enemy fleet is about to wipe me off the map. It's going to be tough to escape that.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Actually, it's going to be super easy, barely an inconvenience.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, really?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah, see, Andy will just use his CO Power, "Hyper Repair," and all of his damaged units, no matter where they are on the entire continent, are instantly healed back to full strength. He also gets a little boost to his attack and defense.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So he just yells "I fixed it!" and suddenly tanks a hundred miles away are magically repaired?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He's a very good mechanic, sir.

**PRODUCER GUY:** I'll say. So who is the big enemy they're all fighting?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** A mysterious army called Black Hole, led by this super intimidating guy named Sturm. He wears a scary mask and a cape and wants to take over the world.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Why?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Because he's the bad guy.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Got it. And what's his special power?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He calls down a giant meteor from space to smash a chunk of your army.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A meteor. In a game about conventional warfare.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Seems fair.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So let me get this straight. It's a deeply complex and strategic wargame, but it has the art style of a Saturday morning cartoon, features child generals with magical repair abilities, and the main villain attacks with space rocks.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** That's the one! What do you think?

**PRODUCER GUY:** I think the strategy nerds will find it too childish and the casual players will find it too complicated. I'm not sure who this game is even for.
