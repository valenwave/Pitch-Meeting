**PRODUCER GUY:** So, you got a new video game for me?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes sir, I do! It's a gritty, hardboiled detective story called *$Disco Elysium$*.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, I like the sound of that. A tough-as-nails detective solving a grisly murder on the mean streets.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly! So the game opens on our hero, a detective, waking up in a completely destroyed hotel room. He has a world-ending hangover, he's wearing nothing but his underwear, and he has total amnesia.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So he's less "tough-as-nails" and more "a walking disaster."

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He's a complex individual, sir. He doesn't know his own name, where he is, or even what a detective does.

**PRODUCER GUY:** How is he supposed to solve a murder if his own brain is a crime scene?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** That's the journey! So he stumbles outside and meets his partner, Kim Kitsuragi, a very patient and competent officer from another precinct who is just trying to do his job.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Okay, so the competent guy will probably have to do all the work. What’s the case?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** A man has been found hanging from a tree behind the hotel. He's been there for a week.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A week? Yikes. Well, getting the body down must be the first priority. I imagine that's going to be pretty tough for our amnesiac hero.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Actually, it's going to be super easy, barely an inconvenience.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, really?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah, all he has to do is examine the body, throw up from the smell, have a heart attack, try to get a kid to help him throw rocks at it, fail completely, and then wait a whole day for his partner to shoot the rope down. See? Problem solved.

**PRODUCER GUY:** That sounds incredibly inconvenient.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So the main feature of the game is that our hero has 24 different skills, and they all have their own personalities that talk to him inside his head.

**PRODUCER GUY:** They talk to him? Like, he's hearing voices?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Constantly! His "Logic" skill will try to piece clues together, while his "Electrochemistry" skill will be screaming at him to find alcohol and drugs. And then you have a skill like "Inland Empire" that will tell him his necktie is talking to him.

**PRODUCER GUY:** His necktie is talking to him.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It's a very helpful necktie, sir! So the gameplay is all about navigating these internal conversations and making choices in dialogue. There's no combat.

**PRODUCER GUY:** What? A detective game with no gunfights?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Correct! In fact, violence is usually a bad idea. He can try to punch a ten-year-old kid and have a fatal heart attack from the effort.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Our hero dies from trying to fight a child. Got it.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It's a cautionary tale! So he solves the case by talking to corrupt union leaders, angry dockworkers, and a couple of cryptozoologists who are looking for a mythical stick insect.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Is the stick insect the murderer?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Of course not, but it's very important to the story for reasons.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Is one of the reasons to make me very confused?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** That's a big one, yes. So eventually, after a lot of political arguments and existential crises, he figures out the killer is an old communist deserter hiding on a tiny island fortress.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Okay, so a big final confrontation with the killer! A shoot-out, a chase scene?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, he just kind of talks to him for a while. And then a giant, seven-foot-long cryptid known as the Insulindian Phasmid shows up.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wow wow wow... wow. A what now?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** A phasmid! A giant stick bug! The cryptozoologists were right all along! It communicates with our hero telepathically about the nature of existence.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So the climax of this gritty detective story is a philosophical discussion with a magical insect.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It's very profound! Then he arrests the old man, and the game ends with his old police unit showing up to give him a performance review.

**PRODUCER GUY:** He gets a performance review?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yep. They just list all the insane things he did during the game, like losing his gun, having a mental breakdown, and punching a mailbox, but they decide not to fire him because, hey, case closed! So, what do you think?

**PRODUCER GUY:** An RPG with no combat about a sad, alcoholic amnesiac who argues with his own brain and talks to giant bugs sounds like a commercial nightmare. It’s so niche and weird, there's no way it finds a mainstream audience. But I have a feeling the people who play it are going to say it's one of the best games ever made.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** My thoughts exactly, sir!
