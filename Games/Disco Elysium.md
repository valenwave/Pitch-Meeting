**PRODUCER GUY:** So, you've got this new game pitch for me, huh? What's the big idea?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Okay, so it's an RPG. Like, a *real* RPG. But instead of fighting monsters with swords, you're fighting your own brain with... words.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Words? Like, you're a poet? Is this a poetry simulator? Because I don't think that's going to move a lot of units.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, no! You're a detective. But you wake up with amnesia after, like, the worst bender ever. You don't even remember your name, or that you're a cop. And your necktie talks to you.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Your... your necktie talks to you? So is it a talking animal sidekick situation? Because we could merchandise that. Little talking necktie plushies.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Not exactly. See, all your skills – like, your intellect, your empathy, your composure – they're all distinct personalities in your head, and they talk to you, and to each other. They're constantly bickering and giving you advice, sometimes really bad advice.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So it's like an internal committee meeting, but for your brain? And you're playing as the guy who has to listen to all of them? Sounds... exhausting.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It's immersive! And you're trying to solve a murder, but it's not just a murder. It's about politics, and class struggle, and existential dread, and the crumbling ruins of a post-revolutionary society!

**PRODUCER GUY:** So it's a detective game, but also a political science lecture, and a therapy session, all at once? Will there be, like, jump scares? Or loot boxes? Because those are proven revenue streams.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** There's no traditional combat! Everything is resolved through dialogue and skill checks. You roll dice, and based on your skills, you succeed or fail, and even failing can open up new, interesting paths. You can literally die from embarrassment, or from having a heart attack while trying to grab your tie from a ceiling fan.

**PRODUCER GUY:** You can *die* from embarrassment? How is that even a game mechanic? What if someone just wants to punch the bad guy? Can they punch the bad guy?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** You *can* throw a punch, but it's still resolved with dice rolls and dialogue. And the consequences are usually more internal and narrative than just, like, a health bar going down. You can be a communist detective, or an ultra-liberal detective, or even a fascist detective!

**PRODUCER GUY:** So I can roleplay as a fascist? That's... a choice. Is this going to be, like, super niche? Because I like my games to appeal to *everyone*. Like, people who love shooting things, and people who love collecting things, and people who love... necktie plushies.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It's a deeply philosophical game, Producer Guy. It's about what it means to be a person, what it means to live in a broken world, and how you pick yourself up when you're a complete wreck.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Huh. Well, that's certainly... something. So, no explosions? No cinematic gunfights? Just a lot of reading and internal monologues?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** And a haunting, atmospheric soundtrack! And a beautiful, painterly art style! And a truly unique world!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Look, Screenwriter Guy, I'm gonna be honest with you. This sounds like it's going to appeal to, like, three people. But those three people are probably going to *really* like it. So, sure, let's make it. What's the worst that could happen?
