**PRODUCER GUY:** So, what's the next big indie game idea you've got for me?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Okay, so it's a roguelike.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A roguelike? Like, you die and you lose everything? That sounds... frustrating.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly! But also, it's a Metroidvania!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Woah woah woah, hold on a second. So you die, lose all your progress, but also you need permanent upgrades to access new areas, which you also lose when you die? How does that even work?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** See, you don't lose *everything*. You keep these things called "runes" which let you access new areas permanently! So you're always making progress, even when you're dying.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, so it's a roguelite then. Got it. So what's the story? Who are you?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** You're a headless corpse. Or, more accurately, an amorphous blob of green goo that possesses headless corpses.

**PRODUCER GUY:** ...Right. So you're just this little green blob that hops into dead guys. And what's your goal?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** You're trying to escape this infected island and kill the King! And then, surprise, you find out you *are* the King!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wait, you're the King? So you're trying to kill yourself? That's a bit... dark. And confusing. So, when you die, you just restart?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yep! Back to the Prisoners' Quarters! But you can unlock new weapons and mutations with "cells" you collect from enemies.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Cells, huh? So, like, cell-shaded graphics?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, just regular cells. From the dead enemies.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Gotcha. And the combat? Is it like... hack and slash?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Fast-paced, fluid combat! You've got melee weapons, ranged weapons, skills, shields for parrying...

**PRODUCER GUY:** Parrying? So I have to press a button at the exact right moment or I get hit? Sounds like a lot of pressure.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Adds to the challenge! And if you don't kill enemies fast enough, you lose your speed boost!

**PRODUCER GUY:** So I have to be good *and* fast? This sounds like it's going to be really hard. People don't like hard games anymore. They like to feel like they're good at games.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** But it's addictive! You just want to try "one more run." The procedural generation keeps it fresh!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Procedural generation... so it's different every time? That's cool. But the story still sounds like it's all over the place. You're a blob, then you're a king, then you're trying to kill yourself, and then you just... loop?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It's about the journey, man! The constant improvement, the discovery of new weapons and synergies! Plus, we've got awesome pixel art!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Pixel art? In this day and age? Are you sure people will go for that?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It's a classic style! It's charming! And the animations are super smooth!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Alright, alright. A roguelite Metroidvania where you're a headless blob possessing bodies, trying to kill yourself, with challenging combat and pixel art. And you die a lot. I don't know, man. Sounds like a niche market. But hey, sometimes those niche markets really take off, right? We'll give it a shot.
