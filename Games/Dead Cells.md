**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So, you have a new video game idea for me?

**PRODUCER GUY:** Yes sir, I do. And I think people are going to find it very relaxing and accessible.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Oh, it’s the exact opposite of that. It’s a game where the main gameplay loop is centered around brutal, soul-crushing failure.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, fantastic! Failure is my favorite genre of entertainment.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Right? So the game is called *Dead Cells*. You play as a prisoner on a creepy, plague-ridden island.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Sounds grim. What did our hero do to get locked up?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** That’s a bit of a mystery! He’s actually just a pile of green goo that slithers out of a sewer pipe and possesses a headless corpse.

**PRODUCER GUY:** He’s a… goo-pile in a meat-suit?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** That’s him! So this headless goo-man has to fight his way through ever-changing dungeons to slay the evil King who is responsible for the plague that turned everyone into monsters. It’s called “The Malaise.”

**PRODUCER GUY:** The Malaise? Sounds like the feeling of having to go to the DMV.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It’s very similar. So you grab a rusty sword and a rickety shield and charge into battle! And then you are immediately killed by a teleporting demon with an axe.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh. Well, that was a short game.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Not at all! Because when you die, your little goo-head pops off the corpse, zips all the way back to the start of the prison, slops into another headless body, and you try again from scratch.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So the main feature of the game is dying and losing all your progress?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Constantly! Dying is tight!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Is it, though? Feels like it would be super hard to make any real progress.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Actually, it’s gonna be super easy, barely an inconvenience.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh really?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah, see, when you kill monsters, they drop things called Cells. And after each level, you meet this shady guy in a cloak called The Collector who will happily take your Cells in exchange for permanent upgrades or unlocking new weapons you can find later.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So you die and lose all your weapons and money, but this strange man lets you keep a receipt for a slightly better sword that you might find on your next attempt?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly! So each failure makes you just a tiny bit less pathetic for the next run. It’s a loop! People love loops.

**PRODUCER GUY:** I do enjoy a good loop. So what kind of enemies are we fighting?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** All sorts! Zombies, giant bats, creepy crawlers, and guys who throw explosive things at you from off-screen where you can’t see them.

**PRODUCER GUY:** That seems unfair.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Whoops!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Whoopsie. So eventually you get good enough to reach the King, I assume?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Eventually! After fighting your way through his ridiculously powerful bodyguard, the Hand of the King, you burst into the throne room for the final confrontation! And that’s when we hit the player with a big twist.

**PRODUCER GUY:** What is it?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** The headless goo-pile you’ve been playing as this whole time… is actually the King!

**PRODUCER GUY:** What?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah, he was a real jerk who messed with alchemy to try and live forever, but it backfired, created the plague, and got himself beheaded. Now he’s stuck as an immortal pile of sludge with amnesia, trying to kill his own original body.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So the entire plot is a hero trying to stop a villain, but the hero IS the villain and he just forgot?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It's super deep. So then you kill your own body, but it turns out there’s a time loop, so you just get sent back to the beginning to do it all over again, only this time it’s even harder.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wow. So the reward for finally winning is that you have to play an even more punishing version of the game?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes! We can sell that as a feature!

**PRODUCER GUY:** A game where you play as an amnesiac goo-zombie who is also the bad guy, stuck in an endless, punishing cycle of death and resurrection, all while armed with a frying pan. It’s brilliant! The frustration will be so palpable, people won’t be able to put it down.
