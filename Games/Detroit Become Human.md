**PRODUCER GUY:** So you have a new idea for a video game?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes sir, I do! It’s called *Detroit: Become Human*.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Okay, sounds… relevant. What’s the gist?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So, it’s set in Detroit, in the future, where androids are everywhere. Like, they do everything. Housework, manual labor, even police work.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Right, because if there's one thing we need more of in Detroit, it's robots taking jobs. Are we trying to make this a comedy?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, no, it's a dramatic thriller! The core idea is that some of these androids start to "deviate." They gain sentience, emotions, free will. And we follow three of them.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Three? That seems like a lot of main characters for a story where every single choice changes everything. Are we sure we want to do that?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Oh, it’s going to be great! We have Kara, a housekeeper android who deviates to protect a little girl from her abusive father.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, a robot Nanny McPhee, but with more domestic violence. Got it.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Then there’s Connor, a police investigator android whose job is to hunt down these deviants. He works with a grizzled human detective who hates androids, so there's a lot of tension there.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Ah, the classic buddy cop dynamic. One's a loose cannon, the other's... a toaster. Is he going to learn to love the toaster?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, that’s up to the player’s choices! And finally, there's Markus, a caretaker android who becomes the leader of the deviant revolution! He wants to free all the androids.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So he’s Robo-Gandhi? Or Robo-Malcolm X? Which one are we going with here? Because those are very different revolutions.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Both! The player gets to decide if Markus leads a peaceful protest or a violent uprising!

**PRODUCER GUY:** And this is a video game, so people are going to want to make all the peaceful choices, right? Just hold hands and sing kumbaya with the humans?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, the choices have consequences! If you choose violence, things could go really bad. Or really good, depending on your definition of good.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Okay, so, what happens if, say, Kara and the little girl are trying to escape, and they get to the border? Do they just walk across?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Not exactly. They might have to make some difficult choices. Like, trying to sneak onto a boat, or a bus, or even sacrificing someone!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Sacrificing someone? For a better ending? So players are going to feel really good about that, I’m sure. And what about Connor? Does he ever deviate? Or does he just stay a good little corporate android?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Again, player choice! He can become a deviant and help Markus, or he can remain loyal to CyberLife and try to stop them! He can even get replaced by another Connor if he dies!

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, you're telling me there are literally thousands of ways this story can play out? Are we building a game or a choose-your-own-adventure book with really expensive graphics?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It’s an immersive narrative experience! Every decision, big or small, has an impact! You can even find out that the little girl Kara is protecting… is an android herself!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Whoa, whoa, wait a minute. She’s an android?! So Kara is protecting an android from an abusive human and doesn’t even realize it? That’s… a choice. A very specific choice.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It adds layers! It makes the player question what it means to be human!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Or makes them question why they spent 60 bucks to protect a robot from a human. I dunno. But hey, people love a good story with lots of branching paths, even if it makes their heads hurt trying to figure out all the possibilities. I think it’ll do well.
