**PRODUCER GUY:** So, what's the pitch?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Okay, so it's a game. You're in a big, open field. And there are, like, a zillion monsters.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A zillion? Like, more than one zillion?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Maybe! It's a lot. And they're all coming at you.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Right. So it's a typical action game. You shoot them, you dodge.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, no, no. You don't shoot. Your weapons just… attack automatically.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wait. So I just… walk around? And things die?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Pretty much! You just focus on moving and picking up experience gems.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Experience gems? Like, from the monsters I'm not even aiming at?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly! And when you level up, you get to choose a new weapon or a passive upgrade. Like a garlic aura that hurts enemies around you, or a whip that just… whips.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So, the game plays itself? Is that the pitch? "The game plays itself, you just watch numbers go up?"

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, no, you're constantly moving, dodging, trying to position yourself so your automatic attacks hit the most enemies. And you've gotta manage your passive items and their evolutions. Like, if you get the "King Bible" and combine it with "Spellbinder," it becomes this unstoppable vortex of holy texts!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Holy texts? So it's a religious game? I thought it was vampires.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It's gothic horror! With Italian memes! The characters have names like Antonio and Imelda, and there's a weapon called "La Borra" which is a reference to some obscure Italian quiz show incident.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Italian memes. So, the gameplay is passive, the characters are obscure references, and the monsters are "a zillion." What's the objective here? To survive?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah, for 30 minutes. Then the Reaper comes for you. And if you kill him, *another* Reaper comes. And then another.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So you can't win? The game just inevitably kills you?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Eventually! But you get gold, and you unlock new characters, new weapons, new stages. And some of those characters have, like, negative health stats. Or they're literally skeletons.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So the game is punishing, passive, confusing, and full of inside jokes. And you're telling me this is good?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It's incredibly addictive! You just want to do "one more run" to see what crazy weapon evolution you can get, or how long you can last against the endless hordes. It’s got that “just five more minutes” feeling.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Hmm. A low-effort, high-addiction loop with bizarre meta-humor. You know what? I think this might just work.
