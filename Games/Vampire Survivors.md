**PRODUCER GUY:** So, you got a video game for me?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes sir, I do. It’s a gothic horror action game called *Vampire Survivors*.

**PRODUCER GUY:** *Vampire Survivors*! I love it. Sounds intense. So you’re a scrappy hero, hiding from vampires, trying to make it through the night.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly! Except you don’t really hide. You mostly just walk around a giant, empty field.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh. And you fight vampires?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, no. The story is that an evil man named Bisconte Draculó has unleashed hordes of monsters. But despite the name, none of them are actually vampires.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Bisconte Draculó? It sounds like Dracula’s name after a game of telephone.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So you pick a hero, like Antonio Belpaese, who starts with a whip, and you go out to fight these monsters!

**PRODUCER GUY:** What kind of monsters?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Bats, skeletons, giant praying mantises, mud men, lizard pawns, milk elementals...

**PRODUCER GUY:** So it’s a game called *Vampire Survivors* where you don't fight any vampires. Nailed it.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So you’re in this field, and endless waves of monsters just start walking towards you.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Okay, so I’m guessing there’s a button for a light attack, a heavy attack, maybe a cool dodge move?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Oh, you don't press any buttons to attack. The character does it automatically.

**PRODUCER GUY:** What? So the game just… plays itself?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, no, you have to do the most important part: walking. You walk around to dodge the monsters and to pick up the little experience gems they drop when they die.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So it’s a strategic walking game.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It’s very strategic! When you level up, you get to choose a new weapon or a passive item. You can get knives that shoot out, axes that fly in an arc, holy water that creates damaging zones, or even a bible that just spins around your body.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A spinning bible that smites your enemies! Weaponized faith is tight!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It is! And as you get more weapons and level them up, you become this unstoppable vortex of destruction! The whole screen is just a firework show of projectiles and death!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wow! So then you finally get to the end and kill Bisconte Draculó in an epic boss battle?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, there’s no final boss. The goal is to survive for 30 minutes.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Okay, and what happens after 30 minutes?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** A big, spooky Reaper shows up.

**PRODUCER GUY:** And you have to fight the Reaper to win?!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, the Reaper is basically invincible and kills you in one hit. The run is over.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So the reward for successfully surviving for 30 minutes is to be immediately and unceremoniously murdered.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes! It’s all about the journey! And you collect gold during your run to buy permanent power-ups so you can do it all again, but better!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Man, getting swarmed by thousands of monsters only to be killed by an unkillable enemy seems like it would be super frustrating for players.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Actually, it’s going to be super easy, barely an inconvenience.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, really?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah, because the gameplay loop of getting more and more powerful is so satisfying that players will become hopelessly addicted. They won’t even care that they always lose in the end!

**PRODUCER GUY:** So a game with super simple, retro graphics, where you only move your character and don't attack, there are no vampires, and the only ending is to die… I don't know, man. It sounds almost too simple to work.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** But it’s going to be super cheap! Like, less than a cup of coffee!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh! Well, for that price, I guess it can’t hurt. It'll probably be one of those weird little indie games that a few hundred people play and then forget about.
