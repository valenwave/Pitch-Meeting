**PRODUCER GUY:** So, you got a cozy little indie game for me?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes sir, I do! It’s this charming 2D platformer called *Celeste*.

**PRODUCER GUY:** *Celeste*. Sounds nice and relaxing. Like a gentle breeze.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, it's about a young woman named Madeline who decides to climb a mountain.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Why?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** She just feels like she has to. To prove something to herself.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So the entire motivation for this game is just a vague feeling?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It's a metaphor for anxiety and depression, sir.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, a fun, lighthearted game about crippling mental health issues. I love it already.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So the gameplay is all about precision platforming. Madeline can jump, climb walls for a little bit, and do an air-dash. That’s it.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A dash, huh? So she can get around pretty easily?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Oh, no, sir. Every single screen is an intricate death puzzle designed to test the limits of human patience. She's going to die. A lot. Like, thousands of times.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wow wow wow… wow. So the relaxing mountain-climbing game is actually an exercise in extreme frustration.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It is! And early on, she looks into a mirror and a physical manifestation of her self-doubt and anxiety comes out.

**PRODUCER GUY:** She's fighting her feelings?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** She sure is! This other version of her, let's call her "Part of You," starts actively trying to stop her, mocking her and creating dangerous obstacles.

**PRODUCER GUY:** My anxiety has never done that. It mostly just makes me re-play conversations from six years ago in my head.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well this one does! So Madeline keeps climbing and meets this cool, chill dude named Theo who's an aspiring photographer for his InstaPix account.

**PRODUCER GUY:** He's trying to get clout on a mountain?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He is. And then they find this huge, abandoned, and very haunted hotel partway up the mountain, run by a ghostly concierge named Mr. Oshiro.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Why would they stay in a place that is actively haunted?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Because it’s cold outside! Anyway, Mr. Oshiro gets really upset when they try to leave and he unleashes a bunch of ghost monsters and chases them through the hotel.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Yikes. It's going to be tough to escape a vengeful hotel ghost.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Actually, it's super easy, barely an inconvenience.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, really?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah, she just has to platform through hundreds of impossibly difficult rooms filled with spikes and monsters while he chases her. And Theo traps her in a magic crystal at one point, which helps.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Getting trapped in a magic crystal by your influencer friend is tight!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So eventually, Madeline has a full-on panic attack and falls all the way to the bottom of the mountain. She's at her lowest point.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh man. So she gives up?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Nope! She has a heart-to-heart with "Part of You" and realizes she can't just fight her anxiety, she has to accept it and work with it.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So she becomes friends with the purple-haired mean girl version of herself?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly! And when they team up, "Part of You" gives Madeline the ability to do a second air dash, and together they fly all the way back up the mountain in this super epic final level.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So the power of friendship with yourself lets you fly. I like it.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So they reach the summit, have a nice moment with their friends, and an old woman who lives on the mountain bakes them a strawberry pie.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A pie? That's the reward for conquering your inner demons and a deadly mountain?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It's a very good pie, sir.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Well, a brutally difficult platformer that's secretly a metaphor for mental illness sounds incredibly niche. I'm not sure if people want their fun video games to also be therapy. It’ll probably sell a few copies to some artsy types and that's it.
