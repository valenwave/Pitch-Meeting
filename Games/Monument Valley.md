**PRODUCER GUY:** So, you got a new video game for me?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes sir, I do! It's a very artistic and beautiful puzzle game for mobile devices.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A mobile game, huh? So it's full of microtransactions and annoying pop-up ads for other games?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, sir, this is a premium experience. It's called Monument Valley.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Monument Valley. Sounds like a fun game about hiking in the desert.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It's not about that at all. So the game is about a silent princess named Ida, and she's walking through these abandoned monuments.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A silent princess? So we don't have to pay for a voice actor. I love it already.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly! So she needs to get from the start of the level to the end, but the paths are all broken and impossible.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, so she has a grappling hook or a double jump or something?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, not at all. The player just has to rotate the entire monument. See, what looks like a giant gap from one angle becomes a perfectly flat walkway when you look at it from a different perspective.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wait, so the solution to these impossible structures is to just turn them until physics gives up?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Precisely! It's all based on optical illusions. The pathways don't have to make sense in 3D space, they just have to look like they connect on the 2D screen.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Breaking the fundamental laws of geometry is tight! So what's stopping her?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, there are these mysterious Crow People who block her path.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Crows! Okay, so she's got a sword or maybe some magic to fight them off?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Nope. She just has to wait for them to walk away, or sometimes you can trick them into walking into the water.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So the main conflict of the game is being mildly inconvenienced by birds.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It's a very zen-like experience, sir. But sometimes Ida will get to the end of a long walkway and there's just a massive, uncrossable chasm in front of the goal.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Yikes. It's going to be tough to get past that.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Actually, it's going to be super easy, barely an inconvenience.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, really?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah, you just turn this little crank on the side of the screen, and a giant tower will rotate in a way that's physically impossible, creating a brand new bridge for her to walk on.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Of course it does. So what's the story here? Why is she doing all this?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, at the end of each level she returns a piece of "Sacred Geometry" to an altar. And eventually, we learn that she's the one who stole it in the first place, and her whole journey is about asking for forgiveness.

**PRODUCER GUY:** She's returning something she stole? Is she going to get arrested for theft?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, it's a deeply emotional metaphor for atonement! And it turns out the Crow People are actually the cursed spirits of her own people!

**PRODUCER GUY:** So she's been tricking her own cursed family members into falling off ledges this whole time. That's dark.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It's artistic, sir. So at the very end, after she returns all the geometry, she's forgiven and she gets a crown and turns into a white bird and flies away.

**PRODUCER GUY:** She turns into a bird. Is that a metaphor for dying?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It's a metaphor for freedom! And being a bird.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Well, an abstract puzzle game with no dialogue, no combat, and a story you can only understand by reading articles about it online sounds like a hard sell. I'm not sure this will find an audience.
