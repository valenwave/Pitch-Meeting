(A Producer Guy sits at his desk, looking very bored. A Screenwriter Guy enthusiastically walks in, holding a stack of papers.)

**Screenwriter Guy:** So, we've got the next *Pokémon* game ready to go! It's going to be HUGE!

**Producer Guy:** Oh, is it? More pocket monsters, more battling, more catching them all? Because, you know, that's what we do.

**Screenwriter Guy:** Well, yes, but this time… it's *different*. We're setting it in a new region!

**Producer Guy:** A new region? Is it, like, based on another part of Japan? Like, somewhere slightly different, with slightly different trees?

**Screenwriter Guy:** Nope! This time, it's based on *New York City!*

**Producer Guy:** New York City? So, like, will the Pokémon battles take place in Central Park? Will there be a Pokémon that's just a rat with a tiny pizza slice?

**Screenwriter Guy:** We have a region called Unova, with a big, bustling city inspired by Manhattan called Castelia City! It's got skyscrapers! And bridges!

**Producer Guy:** Bridges, you say? Groundbreaking. What about the Pokémon themselves? Are we bringing back everyone's favorites? Charizard? Pikachu? That one that's just a pile of goo?

**Screenwriter Guy:** Ah, see, here's the *really* bold part. For the main story, we're only introducing *new* Pokémon! No old ones until after you beat the game!

**Producer Guy:** *Record scratch.* Wait, wait, wait. You want to make a *Pokémon* game where people can't use their beloved Charizard until the post-game? Are you trying to get me fired? That's, like, the entire point of the franchise! Nostalgia! Comfort! Not having to learn 150 new names!

**Screenwriter Guy:** But it forces players to engage with the new designs! It's fresh! It's innovative!

**Producer Guy:** "Innovative" is a fancy word for "risking millions of dollars on a fan revolt." What are these new Pokémon anyway? Anything… inspired?

**Screenwriter Guy:** Oh, absolutely! We have a Pokémon based on an ice cream cone! And one that's a literal bag of garbage!

**Producer Guy:** (Stares blankly for a moment) A bag of... garbage. You know, sometimes I think you just throw darts at a list of inanimate objects. What's next, a sentient stapler? A Pokémon that's just a piece of lint?

**Screenwriter Guy:** Well, we do have a gear Pokémon…

**Producer Guy:** Of course, you do. And what about the story? Is it the usual "beat the gyms, defeat the evil team, become Champion" rigmarole?

**Screenwriter Guy:** Again, yes, but with a *twist*! Our evil team, Team Plasma, isn't just about world domination. They actually believe that *Pokémon should be freed from humans!*

**Producer Guy:** So... the villains are right? Our entire franchise is about keeping these creatures in tiny balls and forcing them to fight, and now the bad guys are calling us out on it? That's a bit... meta. And potentially problematic for our entire business model. Are we the baddies?

**Screenwriter Guy:** It creates a moral dilemma! It makes the player think! And their leader, N, is a complex character who genuinely believes in their cause!

**Producer Guy:** A villain with nuance? In *my* Pokémon game? I just want to collect cute little monsters and make them fight. I don't need an existential crisis with my digital pets.

**Screenwriter Guy:** And we're making the battles more dynamic! The Pokémon sprites will actually animate! And we have Triple Battles, where you use three Pokémon at once!

**Producer Guy:** Three? That's just more math! Who has time for that? I thought this was supposed to be a relaxing escape from reality, not a strategic military operation. And animated sprites? So, they'll be, like, slightly wiggly?

**Screenwriter Guy:** Very wiggly! And the camera will zoom in during attacks! It's cinematic!

**Producer Guy:** Okay, okay, I get it. More wiggles. More garbage. Fewer old favorites. A philosophical debate about animal rights. So, basically, we're taking everything people love about *Pokémon* and making them question it.

**Screenwriter Guy:** It's a fresh take! It's a risk! And critics are calling it one of the best stories in *Pokémon* history!

**Producer Guy:** (Sighs) Fine. But if I get angry emails about the ice cream cone Pokémon, you're buying me an actual ice cream cone. And it better not be garbage flavored.

**Screenwriter Guy:** Deal! And wait until you hear about the sequels! We do *direct* sequels for the first time!

**Producer Guy:** (Puts his head in his hands) Oh, joy. More opportunities for me to question my life choices.
