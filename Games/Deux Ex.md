### **PRODUCER GUY:**
Alright, so what do you got for me today?

### **SCREENWRITER GUY:**
Okay, so it's a video game. A first-person shooter... but also an RPG. And a stealth game. And an immersive sim.

### **PRODUCER GUY:**
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Pick a lane, buddy. Is it an action game or are we making spreadsheets here?

### **SCREENWRITER GUY:**
It's... all of them! You play as JC Denton, an agent for UNATCO, which stands for...

### **PRODUCER GUY:**
The United Nations Anti-Terrorist Coalition. Got it. Very original. So he fights terrorists?

### **SCREENWRITER GUY:**
Well, at first. But then he finds out that his brother is working with the "terrorists," and then he uncovers this huge conspiracy involving the Illuminati and Majestic 12, and a deadly plague called the Grey Death, and a limited supply of its vaccine, Ambrosia!

### **PRODUCER GUY:**
So, a conspiracy thriller? With a plague? Is this set in the future?

### **SCREENWRITER GUY:**
Yep, 2052. And JC Denton has nano-augmentations! He can turn invisible, lift heavy objects, jump super high...

### **PRODUCER GUY:**
Okay, so he's basically a cyborg super-soldier? Sounds like a power fantasy.

### **SCREENWRITER GUY:**
But! You can choose how you play. You can go in guns blazing, or you can sneak around, hack computers, pick locks, or even just talk your way out of situations! There are multiple ways to complete almost every objective.

### **PRODUCER GUY:**
So, like, if there's a locked door, I don't *have* to pick the lock? I could just... punch a hole in the wall?

### **SCREENWRITER GUY:**
If you upgrade your brawn augmentation, yes! Or find a vent! Or hack a nearby security panel! Or sweet-talk the guard into opening it!

### **PRODUCER GUY:**
Wow, that's... a lot of options. Doesn't that make it, like, really hard to design the levels?

### **SCREENWRITER GUY:**
Yeah, probably. But it makes the player feel really smart! And their choices have consequences. Like, if you kill too many people, certain characters might react differently to you later.

### **PRODUCER GUY:**
So, a story with moral choices? That's deep. What about the voice acting? Is it, like, Oscar-worthy?

### **SCREENWRITER GUY:**
Uh... some of it is... *charmingly* dated. Especially some of the minor characters. But it adds to the experience! It's got that classic early 2000s PC game vibe.

### **PRODUCER GUY:**
"Charming," huh? Sounds like we're saving some money on talent. And the graphics? State of the art for 2052?

### **SCREENWRITER GUY:**
Well, it runs on the Unreal Engine, which was good for the time. But it's mostly dark, industrial environments. Lots of browns and greys. Very... cyberpunk.

### **PRODUCER GUY:**
So, visually, it's basically a concrete box simulator. But with super-soldiers and secret societies?

### **SCREENWRITER GUY:**
Exactly! And the story is full of twists and turns! You'll be questioning everything! Is UNATCO good? Are the "terrorists" actually the good guys? What about the Illuminati? Are *they* the good guys?

### **PRODUCER GUY:**
Sounds confusing. People like clear-cut heroes and villains, you know? But you're saying players get to make big choices that affect the ending?

### **SCREENWRITER GUY:**
Yes! There are multiple endings, based on your philosophy and who you side with!

### **PRODUCER GUY:**
So, players have to *think*? In a video game? That's a bold move. But hey, a deep, choose-your-own-adventure cyberpunk game with conspiracy theories and superhuman abilities... I think it could really resonate with people. It's got that niche appeal. People who like to feel smart. Let's greenlight it.
