**PRODUCER GUY:** So, what's the pitch?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Okay, so it's a game. And you play as Dave.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Dave. Okay. And what does Dave do?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He's a diver. He goes into this mysterious place called the Blue Hole.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Right, a diving game. We've seen those. Is it, like, a survival thing? Scary monsters?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, there are some scary fish, sure, like sharks and giant squid. But the main thing Dave does, after he catches the fish...

**PRODUCER GUY:** Yes? What's the twist?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He brings them back to shore, and then he runs a sushi restaurant.

**PRODUCER GUY:** ...He runs a sushi restaurant? So, by day he's a daring deep-sea explorer, risking life and limb, and by night he's... serving nigiri?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly! You catch the fish, prepare the menu, serve the customers, refill their tea, clear their plates... It's very zen.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Zen. Right. So, he's just diving and making sushi. That's it? No plot? No overarching narrative?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Oh, no, there's a huge plot! It turns out there's a hidden civilization of Sea People down in the Blue Hole! And you get involved in their struggles, and there are ancient mysteries, and a secret society trying to exploit the Blue Hole's resources, and a crazy scientist, and you upgrade your gear, and there are boss fights, and minigames where you take photos of fish, and you can farm ingredients, and hire staff for the restaurant, and a rhythm game where you play an instrument...

**PRODUCER GUY:** Whoa, whoa, whoa. So it's a diving game, a restaurant management sim, an RPG, a farming sim, a rhythm game, *and* an adventure game with a deep lore about Sea People? Are you just throwing every single genre you can think of into a blender?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Pretty much! And every time you think you've seen everything, it throws something new at you. Like, one minute you're trying to harpoon a tuna, the next you're helping a lost baby manatee find its mom. Or delivering a rare artifact for a scientist. Or having a cooking competition.

**PRODUCER GUY:** And this... this Dave, he's like, a super buff action hero, right? Like, Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson, but underwater?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He's a little round, actually. Kind of a chill, unassuming guy. He just wants to catch fish and make good sushi.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So you're telling me this game, with a portly diver who moonlights as a sushi chef, where you do everything from deep-sea exploration to serving drinks, and it has a story about ancient underwater civilizations, is going to be a hit? People are going to love this kitchen sink of gameplay?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** I think so! It's charming, it's funny, it's constantly surprising, and it just feels good to play. It's got heart!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Alright, fine. You know what? This is so absurd, it just might work. People like weird stuff. Put a little pixel art on it. Make the characters endearing. Maybe, just maybe, this will be one of those unexpected successes.
