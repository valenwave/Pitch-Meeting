**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So, you have a video game idea for me?

**PRODUCER GUY:** Yes sir, I do. Let's hear it.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Okay, so picture this. We've got our hero, Dave. He's a diver. A pretty chill, slightly out-of-shape guy enjoying his vacation.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Ah, a relatable protagonist. I like it.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So his good friend Cobra calls him up with a business opportunity he can't refuse.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Is this friend going to exploit him?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Massively. So Cobra has found this mysterious body of water called the Blue Hole. The neat thing is, the geography and all the fish in it change every single time you dive!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, a magical, ever-changing ocean hole. That sounds convenient.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It is! Super convenient! So Cobra's idea is this: Dave will spend his days diving into this dangerous, unpredictable abyss to catch fish with a harpoon...

**PRODUCER GUY:** Okay...

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** And then at night, he'll run a high-end sushi restaurant, serving the fish he just caught.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Hold on. The diver is also running the restaurant? Does he have any culinary or business management experience?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Absolutely none.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, good.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** But don't worry, he's got help! There's Bancho, an expert sushi chef who speaks only in intense stares and prepares food with the focus of a samurai. He'll do the actual cooking. Dave just has to set the menu, serve the green tea, pour the beer, grind the wasabi, and clean the tables.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So after a full day of fighting off sharks in the deep ocean, his reward is a stressful night in the service industry? This sounds less like a fun game and more like my twenties.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly! So the core loop is: dive, catch fish, sell fish, make money. And with that money, Dave can upgrade his gear to dive even deeper and carry more fish.

**PRODUCER GUY:** To make more money to upgrade his gear to dive deeper?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** You're getting it!

**PRODUCER GUY:** It sounds a little repetitive.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Oh, it won't be. Because while he's down there, he'll also have to find parts to give to Duff, an anime-obsessed weaponsmith who will make him guns to shoot the fish with.

**PRODUCER GUY:** He's gonna shoot the sushi? Won't that, you know, ruin the meat?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Whoops!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Whoopsie! So he's a diver, a restaurateur, and now a weapons collector. What else?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** I'm so glad you asked. He'll also meet a race of ancient Sea People.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Of course he will.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** And they have a whole problem with their civilization being threatened by earthquakes and zombie mermaids. So Dave has to help them.

**PRODUCER GUY:** How does a diver who is also running a restaurant have time to solve the problems of an ancient underwater civilization?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It's going to be tough for him to juggle all that.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Actually, it's gonna be super easy, barely an inconvenience?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** You know it! He'll also take on quests from an archaeologist to find artifacts, run a farm to grow rice and vegetables, manage a fish farm to breed fish so he doesn't have to catch them all the time, take pictures of specific marine life for a journalist, and collect trading cards based on the fish he finds.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wow wow wow... wow. So let me get this straight. The game is about a diver who is also a sushi restaurant manager, a waiter, a weapons expert, an archaeologist's assistant, a farmer, a fish breeder, a nature photographer, and a trading card collector, all while being the chosen savior for a hidden race of mer-people?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** And he has to manage his restaurant's social media profile on an app called "Cooksta." Getting likes is very important.

**PRODUCER GUY:** My head hurts. What happens if he fails on a dive? Like, if a shark eats him or he runs out of oxygen?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Oh, he doesn't die. He just gets rescued and can only bring one item from his entire haul back with him.

**PRODUCER GUY:** That seems like a very gentle punishment for being mauled by a Great White.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** We want the player to feel relaxed!

**PRODUCER GUY:** While they're managing five different careers and preventing an underwater apocalypse?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Precisely! And sometimes there are special VIP customers and events, like a Jellyfish party or a Shark party, and Dave has to catch specific things for them.

**PRODUCER GUY:** This sounds like the most feature-crammed, genre-bending game in existence. It's a dozen games all wearing one big trench coat.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** And the trench coat is made of delicious sushi!

**PRODUCER GUY:** You know what? It's so completely absurd and all over the place that I feel like people are going to weirdly love it. It makes no sense. I'm in.
