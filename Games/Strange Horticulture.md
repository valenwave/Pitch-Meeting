**PRODUCER GUY:** So, you got a cozy little indie game for me?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes sir, I do! It's called *Strange Horticulture* and you inherit a quaint little plant shop in a town called Undermere.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, a nice, relaxing business simulator. I like it. Very chill.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly! So customers come into your shop every day with requests. One person might want a plant to help them focus, another might want something to calm their nerves.

**PRODUCER GUY:** And you just give them the plant?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, that's the thing. You don't know what any of the plants are. You start with a shelf full of mysterious flora and you have to use an old botany book to identify them.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So the game is just... homework?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It's a puzzle, sir! You look at the leaves, the flowers, maybe the description mentions a specific smell. Then you flip through the book until you find a match, slap a label on it, and boom, happy customer.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Sounds kind of tedious.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It's very atmospheric! Plus, you have a lovely black cat named Hellebore that you can pet.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, you can pet the cat! Well, that changes everything. Game of the Year.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** But then things get... strange. A woman in a dark veil comes in and asks for a plant that can induce visions. Then a detective shows up asking about a plant used for poison because there's been a murder.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wow wow wow... wow. This cozy plant game took a turn.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It sure did! You get a map of the surrounding area and customers give you cryptic clues to find new, even weirder plants out in the wild. Like, "Go to the third tallest peak and look behind a twisted tree."

**PRODUCER GUY:** So you have to leave the safety of your little shop and wander around spooky forests based on riddles?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Super safe, barely an inconvenience. And while you're doing all this, you start getting letters from a local cult who want you to join them.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A cult?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** The Servants of the Dendrew. They worship this big, ancient plant monster that's asleep under the town. They think you're the key to waking it up and, you know, destroying everything.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, just a casual apocalypse. So you obviously tell them no.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, you can if you want! Or you can help them! Or you can help a different group of people who want to control the monster. Or you can help a third group who just want to kill it. There are lots of choices!

**PRODUCER GUY:** So at the climax of the story, you have to stop this plant monster from destroying the world. That sounds tough.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Actually, it's super easy, barely an inconvenience.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, really?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah, see, to stop the monster you have to brew a special elixir. To do that, you just need to correctly identify a few specific plants.

**PRODUCER GUY:** But what if you get it wrong? You're doomed!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** The game saves at the end of every day, so you can just reload and try again until you get it right. No biggie.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Reloading a save file to avoid consequences is tight!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So you can either become the new leader of an apocalypse cult, destroy the monster but cause a bunch of people to die, or banish it peacefully. Lots of endings!

**PRODUCER GUY:** A cozy occult puzzle game where you identify plants and either save the world or end it. This sounds incredibly niche. I'm not sure who the audience for this is.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** You'd be surprised, sir. I think people will really get lost in the mystery.
