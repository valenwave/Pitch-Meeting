**PRODUCER GUY:** So, you got a video game for me?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes sir, I do. It’s a first-person shooter set in an underwater city.

**PRODUCER GUY:** An underwater city? Okay, I'm listening.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So the game opens and our hero, Jack, is the sole survivor of a plane crash in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Convenient.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He swims to a mysterious lighthouse, and inside there's this fancy little submarine called a bathysphere that takes him deep underwater to the city of Rapture.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Rapture? Sounds delightful.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It was supposed to be! It was built in the 1940s by this super-rich guy, Andrew Ryan, who wanted to create a utopia for the world's best and brightest, free from government and religion.

**PRODUCER GUY:** An underwater paradise for smart people. What could possibly go wrong?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Well, they discovered this sea slug that produces a substance called ADAM. It allows people to rewrite their DNA and gain superpowers, like shooting electricity from their hands.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Superpowers from a sea slug. Got it.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** But of course, everyone got addicted to ADAM, and the whole place went crazy. The city fell into a civil war, and now it’s a leaky, art deco nightmare filled with deranged, power-hungry lunatics called Splicers.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So it's a paradise that's now a leaky hellscape. Fun.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So Jack gets a call on his radio from a guy named Atlas. He says his family is trapped and he'll help Jack escape if Jack helps him save them.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A friendly voice in a city of psychos. Seems trustworthy.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** To get more powerful, Jack has to get ADAM. And the only way to get a lot of ADAM is from these creepy little girls called Little Sisters who wander around harvesting it from corpses.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So he just takes it from them?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Not quite. Each Little Sister is protected by a Big Daddy.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A Big Daddy?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah, a giant, hulking guy in an old-timey diving suit with a massive drill for an arm. They're genetically bonded to protect the Little Sisters.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A drill arm! That's going to be tough to fight.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Actually, it's going to be super easy, barely an inconvenience.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, really?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah, Jack can just use his own superpowers and a variety of weapons to take them down. Then he has a choice: he can either harvest the Little Sister for a lot of ADAM, which kills her, or he can save her for a smaller reward.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A moral choice that affects the ending. Very video-gamey.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly! So Atlas keeps guiding Jack through Rapture, telling him he needs to kill Andrew Ryan to escape. And every time he gives an order, he says, "Would you kindly..."

**PRODUCER GUY:** He’s very polite for a guy in a civil war.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So Jack finally makes it to Andrew Ryan's office, and Ryan is just... playing golf. He reveals that Jack is his illegitimate son, who he sold as an embryo to a rival, Frank Fontaine. Fontaine had Jack genetically engineered to be a sleeper agent who would obey any command that starts with the phrase...

**PRODUCER GUY:** "Would you kindly"?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** You got it. Atlas was Frank Fontaine all along, using Jack as a puppet to take down Ryan. Ryan then proves his point by ordering Jack to kill him with a golf club. "A man chooses, a slave obeys," he says.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wow wow wow... wow. So our hero has been the villain's mind-controlled puppet the entire time?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Pretty much! But then a scientist helps Jack break the mind control, and he goes after Fontaine, who has juiced himself up with a ton of ADAM and looks like a weird silver statue.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A final boss fight. Classic.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Jack beats him with the help of the Little Sisters he saved, and depending on his choices, he either escapes to the surface to raise them as his own daughters or becomes the new evil ruler of Rapture.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So you're telling me we have an underwater city, slug-based superpowers, little girls with giant bodyguards, and a mind-control plot twist activated by polite phrasing?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** That's the gist of it!

**PRODUCER GUY:** A game that makes you question free will while electrocuting people in a leaky art deco dystopia... I'm not sure if people will get it, but it's certainly unique. Let's make it.
