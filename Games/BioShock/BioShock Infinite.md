**PRODUCER GUY:** So, you got a video game for me?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yes sir, I do. It’s a little game called BioShock Infinite.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Infinite, huh? So it’s one of those games that goes on forever with no ending?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** No, not at all, it has a very definitive ending. So the game starts and you're this guy, Booker DeWitt. He’s a disgraced Pinkerton agent with a lot of gambling debt. Some mysterious people tell him, "Bring us the girl, and wipe away the debt."

**PRODUCER GUY:** "Bring us the girl." Sounds ominous and super specific. I like it.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So he gets taken to a lighthouse and launches himself into the sky.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Launches himself into the sky? How does he do that?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** In a rocket chair, of course. Super easy, barely an inconvenience.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, really?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah, and he lands in this flying city called Columbia. It's this super patriotic, early 1900s American utopia, except it’s also a racist, hyper-religious police state run by a prophet named Comstock.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A floating city full of fanatics. Sounds like a lovely vacation spot.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It’s great! So Booker has to find this girl, Elizabeth. She's been locked in a tower her whole life, guarded by a giant mechanical bird called Songbird.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A giant robot bird. Of course. Why not?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** And here's the cool part: Elizabeth can open up tears in reality. Like, little windows into other universes.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wow wow wow… wow. So she can just, like, open a door to Paris to grab a croissant?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Sort of! So Booker breaks her out, Songbird gets very angry, and they go on the run through Columbia, which is in the middle of a civil war between the ruling Founders and a rebel group called the Vox Populi.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A civil war in a floating city with a girl who can rip holes in spacetime. This seems fine.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It is! And to escape, they have to navigate all this chaos. At one point they need guns, but the gunsmith is dead. So Elizabeth just opens a tear to a universe where he’s alive but has different problems.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wait, so they can just hop between realities whenever things get tough?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It's going to be tough to navigate these interdimensional paradoxes.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh, really?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Actually, it's super easy, barely an inconvenience. Booker just gets nosebleeds when memories from different realities start merging.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A nosebleed is a fair price to pay for universe-hopping.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Exactly! So they fight their way through the city, and Booker finds out that Comstock knows way too much about him. And there are these two weird, identical people, the Lutece twins, who keep showing up and talking in riddles.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Ah, mysterious and unhelpful NPCs. A classic.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It turns out, Comstock is actually an alternate version of Booker from another reality!

**PRODUCER GUY:** Oh my God!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** Yeah! See, years ago, after a traumatic battle, Booker could choose to be baptized to wash away his sins. In one reality, he refused and remained Booker. In another, he accepted, took the name Zachary Comstock, and, with the help of the Lutece's dimension-hopping science, became a "prophet" and built Columbia.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So the main bad guy is just the main good guy with a beard and a god complex.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** You got it. And because Comstock became sterile from using the dimension-hopping machine, he bought Booker’s baby daughter, Anna, to be his heir. And that baby is Elizabeth!

**PRODUCER GUY:** He sold his own daughter?!

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** He had a lot of gambling debt! Anyway, when Booker tried to back out of the deal, the portal closed and severed Elizabeth's pinky finger, which is what gave her the reality-tearing powers.

**PRODUCER GUY:** So her cosmic power comes from a workplace accident. Got it.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** So Elizabeth realizes the only way to stop Comstock for good across all realities is to go back to the source. She takes Booker to the baptism where it all began. And all these alternate Elizabeths from different timelines show up.

**PRODUCER GUY:** This sounds complicated.

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It is. And they gently drown Booker at the moment of his baptism, preventing him from ever becoming Comstock in any universe.

**PRODUCER GUY:** Wait, so the hero dies at the end? By being drowned by infinite versions of his own daughter?

**SCREENWRITER GUY:** It erases Comstock from existence! It's a happy ending! Mostly.

**PRODUCER GUY:** A mind-bending story about parallel universes, quantum physics, and redemption. It’s ambitious, I'll give you that. People are either going to love it or be incredibly confused.
